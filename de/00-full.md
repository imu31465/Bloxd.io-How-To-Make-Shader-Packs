## Getting Started

A single-track tutorial for first-time shader pack authors, from overview to distribution. It teaches the completed API v5 form directly (there is no need to read older versions first — that is [Version History](../history/)'s job).

### The track

1. [Overview & prerequisites](overview.md) — what shader packs can and cannot do
2. [Requirements](requirements.md) — browser and renderer requirements
3. [Quick start](quick-start.md) — your first pack in 5 minutes
4. [Pack structure](pack-structure.md) — zip contents and size limits
5. [pack.json](manifest.md) — every manifest field
6. [Shader hooks](hooks.md) — the roles of the 9 hooks
7. [Variants](variants.md) — the 6 variants and macro guards
8. [Validation](validation.md) — the 3-stage load check and on-device testing
9. [Distribution](distribution.md) — zipping and release hygiene

## Overview & prerequisites

### What a shader pack is

A Bloxd.io shader pack changes the look of the game's **WebGPU renderer only**. Packs are written in a **restricted subset of WGSL** and loaded from the in-game settings → Shader Pack screen as a zip or folder. While a pack is installed, the WebGPU renderer is force-enabled in settings.

Packs are validated and compiled as pure WGSL — no JavaScript execution, no networking. Nothing dangerous can happen with normal code.

### What you can change (v5)

A pack plugs into the renderer's **3-stage per-face pipeline**. The render targets split into three programs with a total of **9 hooks**:

| Target | Hooks (Vertex / Surface / Light) | What is drawn |
|---|---|---|
| **Terrain** | `bloxdTerrainVertex` · `bloxdTerrainSurface` · `bloxdTerrainLight` | All blocks except water and block models |
| **Liquid** | `bloxdLiquidVertex` · `bloxdLiquidSurface` · `bloxdLiquidLight` | Water |
| **Model** | `bloxdModelVertex` · `bloxdModelSurface` · `bloxdModelLight` | Block models (slabs, stairs, plants), items, players, mobs, NPCs, armour, cosmetics |

- **Can do**: change colors, transparency and emission; rebuild lighting (published as the v5 [Lighting API](../api/lighting.md)); projected-style shadows (via `skyLight`); sample textures (`bloxdTexel` — reading the existing block-texture atlas); per-model effects (v5's `flags` tell you "this is a held item", "this is a player"); vertex animation (allow games only)
- **Cannot do**: add your own textures (that is the texture-pack system's job); post-processing (bloom etc.); shadow-map shadows that rotate with the sun; true reflections (SSR); affect the sky, clouds or the sun disc itself
- **Easy to miss but powerful**: **projected-style shadows using `skyLight` (voxel sky occlusion)** — clearly darken areas under trees and roofs. Breaking blocks makes LightEngine recalculate immediately, so shadows follow in real time

### strict and allow modes

Every game has a shader-pack policy (`shaderPackPolicy`), and **most games run in strict mode** (no vertex animation, no `discard`). Packs for general distribution must work in strict mode. See [Variants](variants.md) and the [policy reference](../internals/policy.md).

### Assumptions in this documentation

- The current game only accepts `apiVersion: 5` packs; v1–v4 packs are rejected at load (saved packs become silently inactive — [Compatibility](../api/compatibility.md))
- Migrating a pack written for an older version? See [Version History](../history/)
- Engine internals may change with updates, so every page names its target build

---

## Requirements

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

### Browser

Shader packs are WebGPU-renderer only. You need a WebGPU-capable browser:

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome / Edge / Opera etc.) — stable on desktop
- Safari 17+ / Firefox (WebGPU support varies by period)
- **Mobile**: WebGPU support may be limited on iOS / Android. Mention this on your pack's release page

While a pack is installed, the game setting for the WebGPU renderer is force-enabled.

### Development environment

No special tooling is required, though these help:

- A text editor (WGSL syntax highlighting is a plus)
- A zip tool for distribution; during development you can use folder loading (desktop browsers only)
- Browser developer tools — compile errors show in the in-game UI and also in the console

### On-device verification environments

Before distribution, verify on ([Validation](validation.md)):

1. An allow-mode game (mandatory if you use vertex animation)
2. A strict-mode game (most games are strict)
3. A page reload (saved packs re-validate automatically)

### URL parameter caveat

Leftover renderer overrides in URL parameters or localStorage make packs refuse to start — clear them and reload.

---

## Quick start

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified

Your first pack in five minutes.

### 1. Create the files

Make a folder with `pack.json` and `pack.wgsl`:

**`pack.json`**:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": 5,
  "name": "My First Pack",
  "author": "your name"
}
```

**`pack.wgsl`** — a minimal warm-tint pack:

```wgsl
const packWarmth = 0.18;

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    let tint = mix(vec3f(1.0), vec3f(1.06, 1.0, 0.92), packWarmth);
    out.colour = clamp(out.colour * tint, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
    return out;
}
```

> The engine header (constants, structures, functions) is prepended to every pack automatically at load — you never write it yourself. The full header is reproduced in [Engine Internals](../internals/engine-header.md).

### 2. Load it in the game

1. Open settings → Shader Pack and load the zip or folder (folder loading is desktop browsers only)
2. Check the status: right after selecting it you'll see "Ready. Reload the page to use it." — after a **page reload**, "Ready to use" means success
3. If you see "Saved, but it won't run until you fix these errors...", fix the listed errors (file:line + variant) and reload

### 3. Verify

1. Test in a permissive game first
2. Then in a strict-mode game (most games are strict)
3. Vertex animation only works in games marked allow

### 4. Distribute

Zip it up — see [Distribution](distribution.md).

### Stuck?

- What errors mean → [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/)
- How to write hooks → [Shader hooks](hooks.md)
- The full 9-hook template is in the next page, [Shader hooks](hooks.md)

## Pack structure

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Verified

### Distribution format

- **Format**: a single `.zip`, or a folder (folder loading is desktop browsers only)
- **Contents**: one `pack.json` (at the top level of the pack; case-insensitive) + 1–256 `.wgsl` files
- Multiple `.wgsl` files are concatenated into one module, so splitting and subdirectories are free. No constraints on file names. Concatenation happens in **dictionary order by path name** (module-scope declarations are order-independent, so this only matters for code depending on `var` initialization order). Non-`.wgsl` files (READMEs etc.) are ignored

### Size and format limits

| Item | Limit | Message when exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| zip size | 32 MB | `The zip is over 32 MB.` |
| zip entries | 1,024 | `The zip has more than 1024 entries.` |
| `pack.json` size | 64 KB (UTF-8) | `pack.json is over 64 KB.` |
| `.wgsl` file count | 256 | `The pack has more than 256 .wgsl files.` |
| total `.wgsl` source | 256 KB (UTF-8) | `The pack's .wgsl files are over 256 KB in total.` |
| zip shape | no zip64 / split / encrypted; store or deflate; no duplicate paths | each rejected with its own message |

All files must be valid UTF-8.

### Zipping tips

A zip that stores everything under one common root folder has that prefix stripped automatically (macOS "Compress" works as-is; `__MACOSX`, `._`-prefixed files and `.DS_Store` are excluded automatically). Stray files at the root level break top-level detection, so the safest method is to zip `pack.json` and the `.wgsl` files directly (verify `pack.json` ends up at the zip root).

---

## pack.json (manifest)

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified

`pack.json` is the pack manifest — exactly one JSON object at the zip root.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": 5,
  "name": "My Pack",
  "author": "your name"
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiVersion` | number | required | Must **exactly equal `5`** (strict `===`). A string `"5"` or any other type fails, reported with the JSON spelling |
| `name` | string | required | Non-empty after trimming. Shown in the settings UI |
| `author` | string | optional | May be omitted; must be a string if present |

All other fields are ignored by the loader.

### What happens on version mismatch

The loader compares `manifest.apiVersion !== 5` strictly and **fails at the instant of load**. Messages, verbatim from the live i18n dictionary:

- `pack.json needs "apiVersion": {{version}}.` — the key is missing entirely
- `This pack is shader pack API version {{packVersion}}. Bloxd supports version {{version}}.` — the key exists but isn't 5

Previously-saved older packs don't throw exceptions; they resolve to `{kind: "none", reason: "otherApiVersion"}` and become **silently inactive**. The shader-pack settings tab explains why:

> `This shader pack is for API version {{packVersion}}, so it won't run. Load a version {{version}} pack to replace it.`

For migrating from v1–v4, see [Version History](../history/).

## Shader hooks

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified

A pack can plug in **9 hooks**: 3 render targets (Terrain / Liquid / Model) × 3 pipeline stages (Vertex / Surface / Light). All are optional — an undefined hook falls back to the engine default.

### The hooks

| Hook | Stage | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `bloxdTerrainVertex` | terrain · vertex | Terrain vertex animation. **Cannot run in strict games** |
| `bloxdTerrainSurface` | terrain · surface | Terrain color, alpha, emission, enchant, overlay |
| `bloxdTerrainLight` | terrain · light | Terrain final color — the last stage of the fragment |
| `bloxdLiquidVertex` | liquid · vertex | Water vertex animation. **strict-only guard required** |
| `bloxdLiquidSurface` | liquid · surface | Water color, alpha, emission |
| `bloxdLiquidLight` | liquid · light | Water final color |
| `bloxdModelVertex` | model · vertex | Block models / items / entities vertex animation. **strict-only guard required** |
| `bloxdModelSurface` | model · surface | Model color, alpha, emission, enchant, overlay |
| `bloxdModelLight` | model · light | Model final color |

Signatures (types must match exactly; parameter names are free):

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex;
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface;
fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight;
// bloxdLiquid* / bloxdModel* take the same types
```

### Render-target split

- **Terrain** — every block except water and block models
- **Liquid** — water
- **Model** — block models (slabs, stairs, crossed-plane plants), held/dropped/thrown items, players, mobs, NPCs, armour, cosmetics

**Important**: if a pack defines no Liquid hook, **no Terrain hook runs on water either** (water is handled by Liquid hooks alone). This differs from pre-v4 behavior where liquid fell back to terrain hooks.

### Fallbacks and code sharing

- An undefined hook means that stage uses the engine default (same behavior as `bloxdDefaultVertex` / `bloxdDefaultSurface` / `bloxdDefaultLight`)
- **To share code across hooks**, define a module-scope function and call it from both:

```wgsl
fn applyWarmth(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    out.colour *= vec3f(1.04, 1.0, 0.96);
    return out;
}

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return applyWarmth(surface);
}

fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return applyWarmth(surface);
}
```

### The default pack (official 9-hook template)

The starting template now includes the light hooks. 1,683 bytes as shipped, verbatim:

```wgsl
// Every hook here returns its engine default. Modify the return values to start
// building a shader pack. If you delete a hook, the default is used instead.

// All blocks but water and block models use terrain hooks.
#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT
// Strict games keep terrain where it is. Without the #ifndef, this hook would
// turn the whole shader pack off there.
fn bloxdTerrainVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    return bloxdDefaultVertex(vertex);
}
#endif

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
}

fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
}

// Water uses liquid hooks. To share code with another hook, define a function
// and call it from both places.
#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT
fn bloxdLiquidVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    return bloxdDefaultVertex(vertex);
}
#endif

fn bloxdLiquidSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
}

fn bloxdLiquidLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
}

// Models: block models such as slabs and plants, items, players and mobs.
#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT
fn bloxdModelVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    return bloxdDefaultVertex(vertex);
}
#endif

fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
}

fn bloxdModelLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
}
```

The template's comments are the design guidance: modify return values to start building; deleting a hook restores the default; strict games keep terrain where it is; share code via functions.

### Writing conventions

- **Never construct output structs directly** (`BloxdSurface(...)` fails validation). Always start from `bloxdDefaultSurface(s)` / `bloxdDefaultLight(s, l)` / `bloxdDefaultVertex(v)` and mutate fields. The light hook's first argument is already the output type, so `var out = s;` also works
- A bare `var x: BloxdSurface;` (type annotation only) is also a validation error
- Hook parameters are **read-only**. Copy first (`var sv = s;`)
- You cannot use identifiers starting with `bloxd` (case-insensitive), except the 9 hook function names
- Write constants as `const` (`#define` takes no value)

For every field each hook can read and write, see [Structures](../api/structures.md).

## Variants and guards

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Analyzed

### 6 variants

You write one body of code, but it must compile in all **6 variants**: `{strict, allow} × {terrain, liquid, model}`. The loader validates all six at load time.

The v4-and-earlier "lighting on/off" axis is gone (v4 had 8 variants). Lighting state is now a runtime question for [`bloxdLit()`](../api/lighting.md), not a compile-time branch.

| Variant | Example | Macros defined |
|---|---|---|
| `allow.terrain` | terrain in an allow game | `BLOXD_ALPHA` |
| `allow.liquid` | water in an allow game | `BLOXD_ALPHA` · `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` |
| `allow.model` | models in an allow game | `BLOXD_ALPHA` |
| `strict.terrain` | terrain in a strict game | — |
| `strict.liquid` | water in a strict game | `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` |
| `strict.model` | models in a strict game | — |

### Conditionals

Only `#define NAME` (no value) / `#ifdef` / `#ifndef` / `#else` / `#endif` are available. The `#` goes at the start of a line (inside functions is fine).

| Guard | Meaning | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` | non-strict (allow) variants only | wrap whole vertex hooks, wrap `discard` |
| `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA` | variants where `alpha` exists (all liquid + non-strict terrain/model) | wrap alpha-touching code |
| `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` | all liquid variants | wrap `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` calls |

`BLOXD_LIGHTING` was **removed in v5**. Using it fails validation with: *"BLOXD_LIGHTING was removed in apiVersion 5; test bloxdLit() in code instead."*

### The strict-games contract

Most games are strict (no vertex animation, no `discard`). An unguarded vertex hook reports `<hook> moves terrain, which strict games prevent.` and a reachable `discard` reports `discard makes terrain see-through, which strict games prevent.` — both disable **all hooks** in that strict game. Always wrap vertex hooks in `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT`.

For per-game policy internals, see [Engine Internals: policy](../internals/policy.md).

## Validation

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified

### The 3-stage load check

1. **Loader limits** — size, shape, manifest validity (see [Pack structure](pack-structure.md))
2. **Static validation (analyzer)** — syntax, types, reserved names, strict contract, across all 6 variants
3. **Real WebGPU compilation in the browser** — static validation's type-checking is incomplete, so some mistakes only surface here

For reading each error, see [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/) (organized by symptom).

### Procedure

1. Load the zip or folder from settings → Shader Pack
2. Check status: "Ready. Reload the page to use it." right after selecting; **after a page reload**, "Ready to use" means success
3. On "Saved, but it won't run until you fix these errors...", fix the listed errors (file:line + variant) and reload
4. Test in a permissive game first, then a strict-mode game (most games). Vertex animation works only in allow games
5. Replacing a pack reloads from the same screen; changes need a page reload
6. Remove with Remove Pack. After game updates, saved packs re-validate automatically on page load (header/registry changes mark them "needs re-check")

### On-device test checklist

See the [testing guide](../guides/testing.md) for the full checklist and the complete list of factors that change what a pack sees.

---

## Distribution

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

### Release format

1. Zip with `pack.json` at the root, within the size limits ([Pack structure](pack-structure.md))
2. Verify `pack.json` sits at the zip root (a single common root folder is stripped automatically)
3. Polish `name` / `author` for release

### Pre-release checklist

- [ ] `apiVersion: 5` (number, not string)
- [ ] All 6 variants pass validation (empty error list on the loader screen)
- [ ] Verified visually in both an allow game and a strict game
- [ ] Vertex-animation / `discard` packs clearly marked allow-only
- [ ] Tested games and date noted in the release notes (builds change)

### After release

- Player-saved packs re-validate automatically when engine header or texture registry change with a game update
- **Packs distributed as v1–v4 become silently inactive** on v5 (see [pack.json](manifest.md)) — players only see the status line, so publish and announce an updated version
- When the API updates, follow [Version History](../history/) migration steps, bump, and re-release

## Pack format

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified (re-measured on the live loader)

The whole pack model on one page — manifest, loader limits, per-frame uniform. For the step-by-step version see [Getting Started](../getting-started/manifest.md).

### pack.json

```json
{
  "apiVersion": 5,
  "name": "My Pack",
  "author": "your name"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiVersion` | number | required | **must strictly equal `5`** (`===`). A string `"5"` fails and is reported with its JSON spelling |
| `name` | string | required | non-empty after trimming; shown in settings |
| `author` | string | optional | must be a string if present |

Everything else in the manifest is ignored. `pack.json` must be exactly one JSON object at the zip root.

### Loader limits (re-measured on live c53)

| Limit | Value | Message when exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| `.wgsl` files per pack | 256 | `The pack has more than 256 .wgsl files.` |
| total `.wgsl` source | 256 KB | `The pack's .wgsl files are over 256 KB in total.` |
| `pack.json` size | 64 KB | `pack.json is over 64 KB.` |
| zip size | 32 MB | `The zip is over 32 MB.` |
| zip entries | 1,024 | `The zip has more than 1024 entries.` |
| zip shape | — | split zip / zip64 / encrypted / unsupported compression each rejected with its own message; all files valid UTF-8; exactly one `pack.json`; no duplicate paths |

### API-version check

The loader compares `manifest.apiVersion !== 5` with JavaScript strict `!==`. The version constant `5` and the header template live in the same module (c55 / module 29836), so validation and the header it assumes move together. Mismatch messages: see [Compatibility](compatibility.md).

### Per-frame uniform: bloxdPackInputs

`@group(3) @binding(0) var<uniform> bloxdPackInputs: BloxdPackInputs` — still 64 bytes, but v5 added one member (from the live uniform-layout module):

| Offset | Field | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `seconds` | `f32` | backs `bloxdSeconds()` |
| 4 | `lit` | `u32` | **new in v5** — 1 when block/sky lighting is on; backs `bloxdLit()` |
| 16 | `renderOffset` | `vec3i` | backs `bloxdRenderOffset()` |
| 32 | `sunDirection` | `vec3f` | backs `bloxdSunDirection()` |
| 48 | `eyePosition` | `vec3f` | backs `bloxdEyePosition()` |

`lit` fit into the padding v4 already had between `seconds` and `renderOffset` (offsets 4–15 were alignment gaps; `vec3i` needs 16-byte alignment so `renderOffset` stays at 16). Total size and all other offsets are unchanged. The engine writes it with a single `setUint32(4, lit ? 1 : 0)` — it is a flag, not a light level (v4's JS-side names `terrainLightLevels` / `terrainHeldLight` are gone from the bundle entirely).

**Never reference the uniform directly from a pack.** Use it through the header functions (`bloxdSeconds()` etc.). Stage visibility is VERTEX|FRAGMENT, so header functions work from module-scope functions and vertex hooks too.

### Bind-group layout

| binding | Contents |
|---|---|
| 0 | `bloxdPackInputs` uniform (64 B) |
| 1 | scene-depth texture (liquid variants) |
| 2 | `bloxdSpTextureLayers` storage buffer |

`minBindingSize` remains 64. The depth texture (binding 1) is FRAGMENT-only, which is why `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` is surface/light-hook only.

### wgsl concatenation

Multiple `.wgsl` files are concatenated into one module in **dictionary order by path name**. Module-scope declarations are order-independent; only `var` initialization order can matter. Non-`.wgsl` files are ignored.

---

## Shader hooks

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Verified

Packs can define **9 hooks** — 3 render targets (programs) × 3 pipeline stages, all optional (undefined means engine default).

### 9-hook comparison

| Hook | Program | Stage | Arguments | Returns | Run condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bloxdTerrainVertex` | Terrain | vertex | `BloxdVertexIn` | `BloxdVertex` | allow variants only (**defining it in strict is itself an error**) |
| `bloxdTerrainSurface` | Terrain | surface | `BloxdSurfaceIn` | `BloxdSurface` | always |
| `bloxdTerrainLight` | Terrain | light | `BloxdSurface`, `BloxdLightIn` | `BloxdLight` | always |
| `bloxdLiquidVertex` | Liquid | vertex | `BloxdVertexIn` | `BloxdVertex` | allow only |
| `bloxdLiquidSurface` | Liquid | surface | `BloxdSurfaceIn` | `BloxdSurface` | always |
| `bloxdLiquidLight` | Liquid | light | `BloxdSurface`, `BloxdLightIn` | `BloxdLight` | always |
| `bloxdModelVertex` | Model | vertex | `BloxdVertexIn` | `BloxdVertex` | allow only |
| `bloxdModelSurface` | Model | surface | `BloxdSurfaceIn` | `BloxdSurface` | always |
| `bloxdModelLight` | Model | light | `BloxdSurface`, `BloxdLightIn` | `BloxdLight` | always |

### What each program draws

| Program | Draws | Water when no Liquid hook exists |
|---|---|---|
| **Terrain** | every block except water and block models | — |
| **Liquid** | water | **no Terrain hook runs on water either** (water keeps its default look) |
| **Model** | block models (slabs, stairs, plants, crops, cobwebs), held/dropped/thrown items, players, mobs, NPCs, armour, cosmetics | — |

### Stage roles

- **Vertex** — move vertex positions (grass sway, waves). Vertex animation disables the whole pack in strict games, so `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` is mandatory
- **Surface** — the material output: `colour` / `alpha` (conditional) / `emission` / `enchantColour` / `overlayColour`
- **Light** — the final color; takes the surface output plus `BloxdLightIn`. Its return value is the on-screen color

### Signatures

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    return bloxdDefaultVertex(vertex);
}

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
}

fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
}
// bloxdLiquid* / bloxdModel* take the same argument and return types
```

### Special-function call restrictions

The engine's validator restricts which hooks may reach certain functions (violations fail with dedicated "reaches" diagnostics):

| Function | Callable from | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `bloxdTexel` | surface / light hooks only | — |
| `bloxdTextureSize` | surface / light hooks only | — |
| `bloxdOpaqueBehind` | surface / light hooks (meaningful in liquid variants) | `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` |

> `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition` was removed in v5 (it was the only special function callable from vertex hooks through v4). There is no replacement — use `flags` when you need "which block is this".

### Fallbacks and sharing

- Undefined hook → that stage behaves as the engine default (`bloxdDefaultVertex` / `bloxdDefaultSurface` / `bloxdDefaultLight`)
- **Share processing across hooks** with a module-scope function called from both:

```wgsl
fn sharedSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    out.colour *= vec3f(1.02);
    return out;
}

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return sharedSurface(surface);
}

fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return sharedSurface(surface);
}
```

## Flags (BloxdFlags)

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored verbatim from the live header)

v5 identifies faces with a named boolean struct. The v4 `blockFlags: u32` bitmask and its 6 `bloxdBlockFlag*` constants are gone.

### Definition (verbatim from the header)

```wgsl
// What kind of block, item or lifeform a face is. Any number of flags may be
// set, possibly even none. For example, sandstone is sand and rock.
struct BloxdFlags {
    opaque: bool,     // Opaque blocks, i.e. full cubes with no gaps or holes.
    emissive: bool,   // Blocks that emit light, e.g. lava and glowing ores.
    vegetation: bool, // Leaves, grass blocks and leafy plants, e.g. tall grass.
    dirt: bool,       // Soil, grass blocks included. Rocky Dirt is rock too.
    sand: bool,       // Sand, Red Sand and every sandstone, which is rock too.
    rock: bool,       // Stone variants, and more, e.g. gravel, ores and magma.

    // Drawn as block models, so never part of terrain or flagged as opaque.
    slab: bool,       // Half blocks.
    stairs: bool,     // Stairs and corner stairs.
    flat: bool,       // Planes, e.g. tall grass, flowers, crops and cobwebs.

    placed: bool,     // Blocks placed as part of chunks. Not items or vehicles.
    held: bool,       // Items in a hand, in first or third person.
    dropped: bool,    // Dropped items, on the ground, on a belt or in a pipe.
    thrown: bool,     // Items in flight, e.g. snowballs, arrows and rockets.

    lifeform: bool,   // Players, mobs and NPCs. Includes armour and cosmetics.
}
```

### Field reference

| Field | Class | Meaning | Typical objects | Hooks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `opaque` | material | full cube without gaps or holes | stone, dirt, solid wood | all 9 |
| `emissive` | material | blocks that emit light | lava, glowing ores | all 9 |
| `vegetation` | material | leaves, grass blocks, leafy plants | leaves, tall grass | all 9 |
| `dirt` | material | soil (grass blocks included) | dirt, grass block, Rocky Dirt (also rock) | all 9 |
| `sand` | material | sand & sandstone family | sand, red sand, every sandstone (also rock) | all 9 |
| `rock` | material | stone family (+ gravel, ores, magma) | stone variants, gravel, ores | all 9 |
| `slab` | shape | half blocks | slabs | Model hooks |
| `stairs` | shape | stairs & corner stairs | stairs | Model hooks |
| `flat` | shape | planes (incl. crossed planes) | tall grass, flowers, crops, cobwebs | Model hooks |
| `placed` | placement | geometry placed as part of chunks | world blocks | Model hooks (not items/vehicles) |
| `held` | placement | items held in a hand (1st/3rd person) | held items, armour | Model hooks |
| `dropped` | placement | items on ground / belt / pipe | dropped items | Model hooks |
| `thrown` | placement | items in flight | snowballs, arrows, rockets | Model hooks |
| `lifeform` | target | players, mobs, NPCs (armour & cosmetics included) | entities | Model hooks |

### Flags combine freely

**Flags are not a single-choice enum.** Any number may be true at once — possibly none (the header itself says *"Any number of flags may be set, possibly even none"*).

Examples the header itself gives:

- **sandstone is both `sand` and `rock`**
- **Rocky Dirt is both `dirt` and `rock`**
- A slab can be `slab` and (depending on material) `rock` at the same time

Reading the `else` branch of one flag as "everything else" is a bug. Material flags (`opaque`/`emissive`/…) combine **independently** with shape/state flags (`slab`/`held`/…).

### Usage

`flags` is a same-named field on all three input structs (`BloxdVertexIn`, `BloxdSurfaceIn`, `BloxdLightIn`):

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.flags.vegetation) {
        out.colour *= vec3f(1.0, 1.08, 0.9);
    }
    if (surface.flags.emissive) {
        out.emission += vec3f(0.05);
    }
    return out;
}
```

In the model pipeline, flags answer "what am I looking at":

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.flags.lifeform && !surface.flags.held) {
        out.colour *= 1.05;   // lift world entities, exclude the hand
    }
    if (surface.flags.held) {
        out.colour *= 1.15;   // brighten the local player's held items
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Migrating from v4 (mechanical)

| v4 | v5 |
|---|---|
| `(surface.blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagOpaque) != 0u` | `surface.flags.opaque` |
| `(surface.blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagEmissive) != 0u` | `surface.flags.emissive` |
| `(surface.blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagVegetation) != 0u` | `surface.flags.vegetation` |
| `(surface.blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagDirt) != 0u` | `surface.flags.dirt` |
| `(surface.blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagSand) != 0u` | `surface.flags.sand` |
| `(surface.blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagRock) != 0u` | `surface.flags.rock` |

Remaining references to the `bloxdBlockFlag*` constants fail the analyzer's reserved-name diagnostic (the constants are deleted).

### Edge cases (exhaustive, from the header)

- «Rocky Dirt is rock too»
- «every sandstone, which is rock too»
- «Drawn as block models, so never part of terrain or flagged as opaque» — `slab`/`stairs`/`flat` faces never enter the Terrain program and never set `opaque`
- «Includes armour and cosmetics» — `lifeform` covers player equipment too
- «Not items or vehicles» — `placed` excludes vehicles

## Input & output structures

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored verbatim from the live header)

Seven structs are readable/writable by packs. Every field is listed below (`#ifdef` fields are conditional). The full header is in [Engine Internals](../internals/engine-header.md).

### BloxdVertexIn (vertex hook input)

```wgsl
struct BloxdVertexIn {
    position: vec3f,      // Render position.
    normal: vec3f,        // Unit vector pointing away from the face.
    localPosition: vec3f, // A model's local coordinates. 0 for terrain/liquid.
    flags: BloxdFlags,    // What kind of block, item or lifeform.
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `position` | `vec3f` | render-space position (world space via `bloxdWorldPosition()`) |
| `normal` | `vec3f` | unit vector pointing away from the face |
| `localPosition` | `vec3f` | model-local coordinates; **`vec3f(0.0)` for terrain and liquid**; for a player's arm, a held sword or windmill blades this rotates with the model |
| `flags` | `BloxdFlags` | face kind ([Flags](flags.md)) |

### BloxdVertex (vertex hook output)

```wgsl
struct BloxdVertex {
    position: vec3f,      // The render position output.
}
```

### BloxdSurfaceIn (surface hook input)

```wgsl
struct BloxdSurfaceIn {
    colour: vec3f,        // RGB colour = texture * tint * ambient occlusion.
    alpha: f32,           // Opacity.

    // Enchanted items and armour only, all 0 for anything else.
    enchantTier: u32,     // 1-5 for Tier 1-5.
    enchantColour: vec4f, // RGB enchant colour, and its animated alpha.
    enchantSpeed: f32,    // How fast the pattern moves, faster at higher tiers.

    // Players and mobs only, 0 for anything else: RGB overlay colour, e.g. the
    // red flash when hurt, and its alpha. bloxdLitColour mixes it into colour.
    overlayColour: vec4f,

    // These mean the same as in BloxdVertexIn, after the vertex hook.
    position: vec3f,      // Render position.
    normal: vec3f,        // Unit vector pointing away from the face.
    localPosition: vec3f, // A model's local coordinates. 0 for terrain/liquid.
    flags: BloxdFlags,    // What kind of block, item or lifeform.

    // These are all 0 if the face has no texture. Most models use textureId 0.
    textureId: u32,       // This face's texture. Compare with bloxdTextureId*.
    textureRotation: u32, // Quarter turns clockwise, which bloxdTexel applies.
    uv: vec2f,            // The texture spans 0-1. fract(uv) is drawn.
    mipLevel: f32,        // Texture mipmap level. 0 = full size, 1 = half, etc.
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `colour` | `vec3f` | RGB = texture × tint × AO, baked by the mesher |
| `alpha` | `f32` | opacity |
| `enchantTier` | `u32` | enchant tier 1–5; 0 for anything not enchanted |
| `enchantColour` | `vec4f` | enchant RGB plus an **animated** alpha (`.a`) — reading `.a` per fragment gives a moving pattern for free; all zero on unenchanted faces |
| `enchantSpeed` | `f32` | enchant pattern speed («faster at higher tiers») |
| `overlayColour` | `vec4f` | entity overlay (hurt flash etc.) RGB + alpha; 0 outside players/mobs; mixed in by `bloxdLitColour` before lighting |
| `position` / `normal` / `localPosition` / `flags` | — | same meanings as `BloxdVertexIn`, **after the vertex hook** (they follow moved vertices) |
| `textureId` | `u32` | this face's texture; compare with `bloxdTextureId*`; **0 when the face has no texture** — most models use textureId 0 (model-owned textures, player skins) |
| `textureRotation` | `u32` | quarter turns clockwise (0–3), applied by `bloxdTexel` |
| `uv` | `vec2f` | the texture spans 0–1; `fract(uv)` is drawn (integer steps tile) |
| `mipLevel` | `f32` | mipmap level: 0 = full size, 1 = half… |

### BloxdSurface (surface hook output)

```wgsl
struct BloxdSurface {
    colour: vec3f,        // RGB colour output.
#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA
    alpha: f32,           // Opacity output.
#endif
    emission: vec3f,      // Emissive RGB, added after lighting, before fog.
    enchantColour: vec4f, // Enchant output, mixed in by bloxdLitColour.
    overlayColour: vec4f, // Overlay output, mixed in by bloxdLitColour.
}
```

| Field | Type | Condition | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `colour` | `vec3f` | always | RGB output |
| `alpha` | `f32` | `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA` (all liquid + non-strict terrain/model) | opacity output |
| `emission` | `vec3f` | always | emissive RGB — **added after lighting, before fog** |
| `enchantColour` | `vec4f` | always | enchant output, mixed in by `bloxdLitColour` |
| `overlayColour` | `vec4f` | always | overlay output, mixed in by `bloxdLitColour` |

`bloxdDefaultSurface` passes `enchantColour` / `overlayColour` through unchanged, so the default look matches v4's engine-internal behavior. Zero `out.enchantColour` to remove the glint under custom lighting; amplify `out.overlayColour.a` to emphasize the hurt flash.

### BloxdLightIn (light hook input)

```wgsl
struct BloxdLightIn {
    litColour: vec3f,  // Lit and enchanted RGB colour, before emission and fog.
    directional: f32,  // Summed Lambert from directional lights; 0 if none.
    diffuse: vec3f,    // The material's RGB response to directional light.
    emissive: vec3f,   // The material's RGB glow, added to directional light.
    ambient: vec3f,    // RGB ambient colour, added to directional light.
    blockLight: vec3f, // RGB block light; 0 when !bloxdLit().
    skyLight: f32,     // Sky light; 1 when !bloxdLit().
    ambientLightColour: vec3f, // Minimum RGB light; 1 when !bloxdLit().
    skyLightColour: vec3f, // RGB colour of skyLight; 1 when !bloxdLit().
    heldLight: vec3f,  // RGB held light; 0 when !bloxdLit() or no light held.
    fogColour: vec3f,  // The game's RGB fog colour; 0 when the game has no fog.
    fogAlpha: f32,     // 0 = no fog, 1 = only fogColour.

    // These are the same as in BloxdSurfaceIn.
    position: vec3f,      // Render position.
    normal: vec3f,        // Unit vector pointing away from the face.
    localPosition: vec3f, // A model's local coordinates. 0 for terrain/liquid.
    flags: BloxdFlags,    // What kind of block, item or lifeform.
    textureId: u32,       // This face's texture. Compare with bloxdTextureId*.
    textureRotation: u32, // Quarter turns clockwise, which bloxdTexel applies.
    uv: vec2f,            // The texture spans 0-1. fract(uv) is drawn.
    mipLevel: f32,        // Texture mipmap level. 0 = full size, 1 = half, etc.
}
```

Field-by-field meaning and role in lighting math: see [Lighting](lighting.md).

**Versus v4**:

- `fogVisibility: f32` (1 = no fog) was renamed **`fogAlpha: f32` (0 = no fog, 1 = only fogColour)** — semantics inverted
- `diffuse` / `emissive` are new in v5 (v4 had only `directional` and `ambient`) — `bloxdShading()` can now rebuild the material response
- `engineColour` (v2–v4) is gone; `litColour` is «Lit and enchanted RGB colour, before emission and fog»
- light-level wording changed from «0 without BLOXD_LIGHTING» to «0 when !bloxdLit()» — the same facts in v5 vocabulary

### BloxdLight (light hook output)

```wgsl
struct BloxdLight {
    colour: vec3f, // RGB colour output.
}
```

### BloxdOpaqueBehind (special-function return)

```wgsl
struct BloxdOpaqueBehind {
    hit: bool,       // False where nothing opaque is behind (sky).
    position: vec3f, // The render position; 0 when !hit.
    distance: f32,   // From the camera; 0 when !hit.
}
```

Return value of `bloxdOpaqueBehind()`. Use in liquid variants behind an `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` guard (the field was `found: bool` in v2).

### Conditional fields ↔ macros

| Field | Exists when | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `BloxdSurface.alpha` | `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA` | all liquid variants + non-strict terrain/model |
| `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` call | `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` | all liquid variants |

`BLOXD_STRICT` controls **hook existence** (vertex hooks), not struct shape. See [Preprocessor](preprocessor.md).

### Writing conventions (recap)

- Never construct output structs directly — start from `bloxdDefault*`; in light hooks `var out = s;` also works
- A bare `var x: BloxdSurface;` is a validation error
- Hook parameters are read-only — copy before mutating

## Functions

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored verbatim from the live header)

Every header function. The texture API (`bloxdTexel` / `bloxdTextureSize` / `bloxdTextureId*`) is covered in [Texture API](texture-api.md), along with `bloxdOpaqueBehind`.

### Frame functions (same value for the entire frame)

Header note: *"These functions return the same value for the entire frame."* They read the `bloxdPackInputs` uniform, so they are callable from vertex hooks and module-scope functions too.

#### bloxdEyePosition

```wgsl
fn bloxdEyePosition() -> vec3f
```

- **Returns**: the camera's render position
- **Callable from**: all 9 hooks + module scope
- **Uses**: view vectors (`normalize(l.position - bloxdEyePosition())`), rim light, distances

#### bloxdRenderOffset

```wgsl
fn bloxdRenderOffset() -> vec3i
```

- **Returns**: integer block offset; **render position + this offset = world position**
- Changes as the player travels (keeps render positions near 0,0,0)
- Used internally by `bloxdWorldPosition()`

#### bloxdSunDirection

```wgsl
fn bloxdSunDirection() -> vec3f
```

- **Returns**: unit vector toward the sun in world orientation; **zero vector when there is no sun**
- **Facts**:
  - **the moon is always at `-bloxdSunDirection()`** (the engine places it opposite the sun)
  - **never pass the zero vector to `normalize`** — guard with `dot(d, d) < 1e-8` and fall back to a constant direction
  - the current build has no day-night cycle; sun, moon and stars do not move during a session (only opacity toggles). In the default earth sky the sun sits near `(−0.56, 0.81, −0.18)` (elevation ≈ 54°)
- **Uses**: color temperature, light direction, sun gating, pseudo moonlight

#### bloxdSeconds

```wgsl
fn bloxdSeconds() -> f32
```

- **Returns**: seconds since the page loaded (no wrap — f32 keeps sub-millisecond precision for the first 4.5 hours)
- **Uses**: animation; recurring timers via `bloxdSeconds() % period`
- **Note**: unlike v2's `bloxdTime()` (which wrapped at 3600s), it does not wrap

#### bloxdLit

```wgsl
// Whether block and sky lighting is on. When it's off, BloxdLightIn's
// blockLight and heldLight are 0, and its skyLight and light colours are 1.
fn bloxdLit() -> bool
```

- **Returns**: whether block & sky lighting is enabled
- **New in v5**: replaces v4's `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` compile-time branch with a runtime check
- **Guarantees when off** (header note): `blockLight` and `heldLight` are 0; `skyLight` and the light colors (`ambientLightColour` / `skyLightColour`) are 1
- **Use**: gate lighting-dependent code:

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    if (!bloxdLit()) { return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light); }
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
    // ... lighting-enabled processing
    return out;
}
```

Using `BLOXD_LIGHTING` produces *"BLOXD_LIGHTING was removed in apiVersion 5; test bloxdLit() in code instead."*

### Coordinate conversion

#### bloxdWorldPosition

```wgsl
// Convert a render position to a world position, with possible f32 inaccuracy.
fn bloxdWorldPosition(position: vec3f) -> vec3f
```

- **Returns**: `position + vec3f(bloxdRenderOffset())`
- **Note**: f32 precision limits mean far coordinates can be inexact (header: *"with possible f32 inaccuracy"*)

#### bloxdFragmentBlockPosition — removed

`bloxdFragmentBlockPosition(position: vec3f, normal: vec3f) -> vec3i` (existed through v4) was **removed in v5 with no replacement**. It reconstructed a fragment's block position from position and normal, but nothing remained that needed it between `uv`, `flags` and the model inputs; continuous values are covered by `bloxdWorldPosition()`. Delete call sites.

### Default functions (engine behavior)

#### bloxdDefaultVertex

```wgsl
fn bloxdDefaultVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex
// impl: return BloxdVertex(vertex.position);
```

#### bloxdDefaultSurface

```wgsl
fn bloxdDefaultSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface
```

Passes `colour` through, passes `enchantColour` / `overlayColour` unchanged, zeroes `emission` (and passes `alpha` in `BLOXD_ALPHA` variants). **Output structs can only be built via this function.**

#### bloxdDefaultLight

```wgsl
fn bloxdDefaultLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight
// impl:
//   let lit = bloxdLitColour(surface, light);
//   return BloxdLight(bloxdApplyFog(lit + surface.emission, light));
```

Literally "apply the engine's recipe, then fog the emission-added result".

### Lighting recipe functions (published in v5)

What v4 authors kept re-deriving by hand is now documented as callable WGSL. Explanations and the flow diagram: [Lighting](lighting.md).

| Function | Signature | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `bloxdShading` | `(light: BloxdLightIn) -> vec3f` | how the face's material & angle light it (Lambert × diffuse + emissive + ambient, clamped 0–1) |
| `bloxdWorldLight` | `(light: BloxdLightIn) -> vec3f` | the world's light here (brightest of block/sky/held, floored by `ambientLightColour`) |
| `bloxdLitColour` | `(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> vec3f` | the surface's color lit as the engine does (before emission and fog) |
| `bloxdApplyFog` | `(colour: vec3f, light: BloxdLightIn) -> vec3f` | apply this fragment's fog (`mix(colour, fogColour, fogAlpha)`) |

### Special functions

#### bloxdOpaqueBehind

```wgsl
fn bloxdOpaqueBehind() -> BloxdOpaqueBehind
```

- **Returns**: `BloxdOpaqueBehind` (`hit: bool`, `position: vec3f`, `distance: f32`)
- **Callable from**: surface / light hooks only (the depth texture is FRAGMENT-only)
- **Guard**: `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` (defined in liquid variants)
- **Meaning**: the opaque face behind this fragment (terrain seen through water); `hit == false` for sky
- **Rename from v2**: `found` → `hit`
- **Deep dive**: [Version History: v3](../history/v3.md) and [Engine Internals](../internals/rendering-pipeline.md)

## Lighting

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored verbatim from the live header)

v5 published the lighting API. What the engine did internally (building `litColour`) is now callable from packs. This page covers the lighting inputs, functions, and processing order as a system.

### The full pipeline

The complete color chain, as the default light-stage implementation (`bloxdDefaultLight`) shows it:

```
surface.colour
    │  mix with overlayColour (mix(colour, overlay.rgb, overlay.a))
    ▼
overlaid
    │  multiply by bloxdShading(light) — material & angle response
    ▼
shaded
    │  mix with enchantColour (mix(shaded, enchant.rgb, enchant.a))
    ▼
enchanted
    │  multiply by bloxdWorldLight(light) — world light (brightest of block/sky/held)
    ▼
lit = bloxdLitColour(surface, light)   ← the color "before emission and fog"
    │  + surface.emission               ← emission added after lighting
    ▼
    │  bloxdApplyFog(colour, light)      ← mix(colour, fogColour, fogAlpha)
    ▼
BloxdLight.colour (final color)
```

`bloxdLitColour()` order (header summary: *"mixed with overlayColour, then bloxdShading, then mixed with enchantColour, then bloxdWorldLight"*):

1. apply `overlayColour`
2. shade with `bloxdShading()`
3. apply `enchantColour`
4. apply world light with `bloxdWorldLight()`

Emission and fog order: **emission is added after lighting and before fog**, and fog sinks emission too (`bloxdDefaultLight` = `bloxdApplyFog(lit + emission, light)`).

### Functions

#### bloxdLit() — the gate

```wgsl
fn bloxdLit() -> bool
```

Whether block & sky lighting is on. **Guarantees when off**:

| Field | Value when off |
|---|---|
| `blockLight` / `heldLight` | `0` |
| `skyLight` | `1` |
| `ambientLightColour` / `skyLightColour` | `1` (white) |

v4's `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` is gone. Replace with `if (!bloxdLit()) { return bloxdDefaultLight(...); }`.

#### bloxdShading() — material & angle response

```wgsl
fn bloxdShading(light: BloxdLightIn) -> vec3f {
    let diffuse = light.directional * light.diffuse;
    return saturate(diffuse + light.emissive + light.ambient);
}
```

- multiplies `directional` (summed Lambert) by `diffuse` (material RGB response), adds `emissive` (material glow) and `ambient` (RGB ambient), clamps to 0–1
- **the new v5 inputs `diffuse` / `emissive`** let you swap just the Lambert term while keeping the engine's material response

#### bloxdWorldLight() — the world's light

```wgsl
fn bloxdWorldLight(light: BloxdLightIn) -> vec3f {
    let ambientLight = light.ambientLightColour;
    let blockLight = ambientLight + light.blockLight * (1.0 - ambientLight);
    let skyLight = mix(ambientLight, light.skyLightColour, light.skyLight);
    let heldLight = ambientLight + light.heldLight * (1.0 - ambientLight);
    return max(max(blockLight, skyLight), heldLight);
}
```

- shapes each of the three channels (block / sky / held) with `ambientLightColour` as the floor, then takes the **brightest**
- `skyLight` interpolates from `ambientLightColour` toward `skyLightColour` by the sky-light amount

#### bloxdLitColour() — the engine recipe

```wgsl
fn bloxdLitColour(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> vec3f {
    let overlay = surface.overlayColour;
    let overlaid = mix(surface.colour, overlay.rgb, overlay.a);
    let shaded = bloxdShading(light) * overlaid;
    let enchant = surface.enchantColour;
    let enchanted = mix(shaded, enchant.rgb, enchant.a);
    return max(enchanted * bloxdWorldLight(light), vec3f(0.0));
}
```

#### bloxdApplyFog() — fog

```wgsl
fn bloxdApplyFog(colour: vec3f, light: BloxdLightIn) -> vec3f {
    return mix(colour, light.fogColour, light.fogAlpha);
}
```

- `fogAlpha`: **0 = no fog, 1 = only fogColour** (inverted from v4's `fogVisibility`)
- `fogColour` is the game's fog RGB; **`vec3f(0.0)` when the game has no fog**

#### bloxdDefaultLight() — the whole default

```wgsl
fn bloxdDefaultLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    let lit = bloxdLitColour(surface, light);
    return BloxdLight(bloxdApplyFog(lit + surface.emission, light));
}
```

### Input fields (BloxdLightIn)

| Field | Type | Meaning | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `litColour` | `vec3f` | lit & enchanted RGB (before emission and fog) | a result value, not a source |
| `directional` | `f32` | summed Lambert from directional lights | 0 when no directional lights |
| `diffuse` | `vec3f` | material RGB response to directional light | new in v5 |
| `emissive` | `vec3f` | material RGB glow (added to directional) | new in v5 |
| `ambient` | `vec3f` | RGB ambient (added to directional) | |
| `blockLight` | `vec3f` | RGB block light | 0 when `!bloxdLit()` |
| `skyLight` | `f32` | sky light | 1 when `!bloxdLit()` |
| `ambientLightColour` | `vec3f` | minimum RGB light (floor) | 1 when `!bloxdLit()` |
| `skyLightColour` | `vec3f` | RGB color of skyLight | 1 when `!bloxdLit()` |
| `heldLight` | `vec3f` | RGB held light | 0 when `!bloxdLit()` or nothing held |
| `fogColour` | `vec3f` | game fog RGB | 0 with no fog |
| `fogAlpha` | `f32` | 0 = no fog, 1 = only fogColour | inverted from v4 `fogVisibility` |

### Light-level physics (background, skippable)

- **`blockLight` / `skyLight` / `heldLight` arrive mapped to 0–1**: the 0–15 levels through an ease-out curve (e.g. `6 → 0.45`, `12 → 0.92`). All exclude `ambientLightColour`
- **Lift curve**: `skyLight` is really "can this position see the sky" — voxel occlusion data, i.e. a shadow map. Threshold-based sun/shade separation may need the inverse transform (see the [realism guide](../guides/realism.md))
- **Fog internals**: in linear mode `fogAlpha = 1 - (fogEnd - dist) / (fogEnd - fogStart)` (clamped 0..1), computed per vertex in view space. The current build is linear-only (details in [Engine Internals: Fog Internals](../internals/fog-internals.md))

### Recipes

#### Custom shading + the engine's world light

What v4 authors approximated by scaling `litColour` can now be written exactly:

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    let nDotL = light.directional; // already summed Lambert
    let wrapped = nDotL * 0.5 + 0.5;
    let shaded = saturate(wrapped * light.diffuse + light.emissive + light.ambient);
    let colour = max(shaded * bloxdWorldLight(light), vec3f(0.0));
    return BloxdLight(bloxdApplyFog(colour + surface.emission, light));
}
```

#### Keep the engine's world light, boost emission only

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    let lit = bloxdLitColour(surface, light);
    return BloxdLight(bloxdApplyFog(lit + surface.emission * 2.0, light));
}
```

#### Night blue shift (skyLight-driven)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    if (!bloxdLit()) { return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light); }
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
    let night = 1.0 - light.skyLight;
    out.colour = mix(out.colour, out.colour * vec3f(0.75, 0.82, 1.15), night * 0.6);
    return out;
}
```

## Texture API

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Verified (API unchanged since v4, re-confirmed on the v5 build)

The API for reading the block-texture atlas, introduced in v4 and carried into v5 unchanged. Two functions, a named-constant family, and four input fields. The header's own one-liner: *"This face's texture. Compare with `bloxdTextureId*`."*

### bloxdTexel

```wgsl
fn bloxdTexel(textureId: u32, uv: vec2f, mipLevel: f32) -> vec4f
```

- **Callable from**: **surface / light hooks only** (reaching it from a vertex hook fails with a "reaches" diagnostic)

Samples the block-texture atlas **exactly as the engine's own sampler does** — same `texture_2d_array<f32>` atlas, same sampler, `textureSampleLevel` at `round(mipLevel)` — so the texel you read structurally matches the texel the engine drew.

Semantics:

- **`textureId == 0` returns `vec4f(1.0)` (white).** That is the "no texture" id; texture-less faces carry 0 in all four input fields, so `bloxdTexel(surface.textureId, ...)` is always safe to call
- **Animated textures automatically return the current frame.** Frames advance on the game's animation clock — you cannot stop or step them, and never need to
- **`mipLevel` clamps exactly like the engine's own**: `clamp(round(mipLevel), 0, textureNumLevels(textureAtlas0) - 1)`; out-of-range mips saturate rather than error
- **The fragment's own `textureRotation` is applied to the uv you pass** (see below)

`textureId` is **1-based**: `bloxdTextureIdGrassTop` is the id, and the atlas layer the engine samples for it is `id - 1`. Ids are stable per texture *name*, not per atlas slot — the engine reshuffles the atlas across builds, but the named comparison keeps its meaning.

### bloxdTextureSize

```wgsl
fn bloxdTextureSize(mipLevel: f32) -> vec2u
```

- **Callable from**: surface / light hooks only

`textureDimensions(textureAtlas0, <clamped mip>)`. Each texture occupies one array layer, so this is also *the texel size of any one texture at that mip* (all block textures in an atlas tier are the same square size).

```wgsl
// texel-aligned resampling for a "pixel-art" look
let size = bloxdTextureSize(surface.mipLevel);
let uv = fract(surface.uv);
let texel = bloxdTexel(surface.textureId, uv, surface.mipLevel);
```

### Model-owned textures (textureId: 0)

**`bloxdTexel()` can also read model-owned textures** — most notably via `textureId: 0`:

- **Player skins** and other non-atlas model textures (mobs etc.) use `textureId: 0`
- Header note: *"These are all 0 if the face has no texture. **Most models use textureId 0.**"* — most models bypass the atlas
- Passing 0 to `bloxdTexel()` returns white `vec4f(1.0)`, never an error. Atlas-reading code takes effect only on faces with `textureId != 0u`:

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.textureId != 0u) {
        // only faces whose texture lives in the atlas (block models)
        let t = bloxdTexel(surface.textureId, fract(surface.uv), surface.mipLevel);
        out.colour = mix(out.colour, t.rgb, 0.2);
    }
    return out;
}
```

- **Skins vs the atlas**: the atlas maps texture *names* to layers and is comparable via `bloxdTextureId*`. Model-owned textures (skins) are not in that namespace and arrive as id 0. `surface.colour` already contains skin × tint, so work from it
- **`bloxdTextureSize()`** still reports the *atlas* size on model faces (not the model texture's size)

### bloxdTextureId*: named texture constants

Every usable texture name becomes a comparable `const`. **Spelling is the file name CamelCased**:

| Texture file | Constant | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `grass_top.png` | `bloxdTextureIdGrassTop` | the engine's own example |
| `lava0.png` (frames `lava0`–`lava7`) | `bloxdTextureIdLava` | animation family: frame suffixes drop from the canonical name |
| `black_portal0.png` (frames 0–3) | `bloxdTextureIdBlackPortal` | same rule |
| `radar_screen0` (turned copies `[rot[1`–`[rot[4`) | `bloxdTextureIdRadarScreen0` | rotation family: folds to the root name |

#### Spelling rules and naming freedom

- **Generation rule** (restored from the validator): split the name on non-alphanumeric runs, capitalize each part, concatenate after the `bloxdTextureId` prefix
- **Case and underscores are not distinguished**: reverse matching (the name a pack wrote → registry name) folds both your spelling and the engine's, so e.g. `bloxdTextureIdGrassTop` and `bloxdTextureId_grass_top` resolve to **the same constant**
- **Animated textures take no frame number**: `lava` is the name; `lava0` is a dedicated error
- **Rotation families use the root name**: writing a turned-copy spelling produces a dedicated message

#### Name-resolution errors (verbatim from the validator)

> **Prefix misspelling / case:** `bloxdTextureIdGrassTop isn't part of the shader pack API. Texture names start with exactly bloxdTextureId: did you mean bloxdTextureIdGrassTop?`
>
> **Animation frame:** `...names a frame of the animated texture lava: use bloxdTextureIdLava, which bloxdTexel animates.`
>
> **Turned copy:** `...names a turned copy of radar_screen0: use bloxdTextureIdRadarScreen0, which bloxdTexel turns as each face shows it.`
>
> **Ambiguous after folding:** `...could name X and Y, which differ only by case or underscores, so it can't be used.`
>
> **Not found (with suggestion):** `There's no texture called X. Did you mean bloxdTextureIdY?` — suggestion threshold is Levenshtein distance `max(2, floor(len/4)) + 1` (new in v5)
>
> **Not found (no suggestion):** `There's no texture called X. Texture names are the file names texture packs use, as in bloxdTextureIdGrassTop for grass_top.png; BLOCK_TEXTURES.md lists them.`

#### Only referenced constants are emitted

The header's `bloxdTextureId*` block is generated **per pack** from the names it actually references — a pack using 3 constants gets 3 `const` lines, not ~900.

### Input fields

The four texture fields on `BloxdSurfaceIn` / `BloxdLightIn`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `textureId` | `u32` | this face's texture; compare with `bloxdTextureId*`; 0 = none |
| `textureRotation` | `u32` | quarter turns clockwise (0–3), applied by `bloxdTexel` |
| `uv` | `vec2f` | the texture spans 0–1; `fract(uv)` is drawn |
| `mipLevel` | `f32` | mip level: 0 = full size, 1 = half… |

### The rotation subtlety — a neutral sampler

`bloxdTexel` counter-rotates the uv you pass by the **current fragment's** `textureRotation` — regardless of which id you passed. Two common cases:

- **Re-sampling this face's own texture** with `surface.uv` — the uv is in the face's rotated frame and the counter-rotation maps back to atlas space; the intended primary use
- **Sampling a different texture** with atlas-space uv while the face is rotated — the counter-rotation still fires and the sample lands rotated. That's the trap

The engine cannot look up per-texture rotation (rotation is face geometry data) and always uses the fragment's value. To sample another texture rotation-neutrally, pre-rotate the uv by the same quarter turn to cancel it:

```wgsl
// Rotation-neutral texel sampling: pre-rotate uv so bloxdTexel's counter-rotation
// (by this face's textureRotation) cancels out. Pass surface.textureRotation as r.
fn texelNeutral(id: u32, uv: vec2f, mip: f32, r: u32) -> vec4f {
    var turned = uv;
    if (r == 1u) {
        turned = vec2f(1.0 - uv.y, uv.x);
    } else if (r == 2u) {
        turned = vec2f(1.0 - uv.x, 1.0 - uv.y);
    } else if (r == 3u) {
        turned = vec2f(uv.y, 1.0 - uv.x);
    }
    return bloxdTexel(id, turned, mip);
}
```

(`textureRotation == 0` needs no correction. Most faces carry 0, but distributed packs must not assume it.)

### Worked examples

#### Emission from texel luminance

Sample one mip above the face's for a distance-robust soft blocky average:

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    let avg = bloxdTexel(surface.textureId, surface.uv, surface.mipLevel + 1.0);
    let lum = dot(avg.rgb, vec3f(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722));
    if (surface.flags.emissive) {
        out.emission += avg.rgb * lum * 0.5;
    }
    return out;
}
```

#### Texture-specific effects

Compare `textureId` to single out chosen textures (the official way to e.g. sparkle ores):

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
    if (light.textureId == bloxdTextureIdDiamondOre) {
        let p = bloxdWorldPosition(light.position);
        let s = sin(bloxdSeconds() * 3.0 + p.x * 2.7 + p.y * 1.3 + p.z * 4.1);
        out.colour += vec3f(0.35, 0.45, 0.55) * max(0.0, s);
    }
    return out;
}
```

#### Depth-of-field-style distance blur

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    let d = distance(surface.position, bloxdEyePosition());
    if (d > 40.0 && surface.textureId != 0u) {
        let own = bloxdTexel(surface.textureId, surface.uv, surface.mipLevel);
        if (any(abs(own.rgb - vec3f(0.0)) > vec3f(1e-6))) {          // division guard
            let blur = clamp((d - 40.0) / 60.0, 0.0, 3.0);
            let t = bloxdTexel(surface.textureId, surface.uv, surface.mipLevel + blur);
            out.colour = t.rgb / own.rgb * out.colour;
        }
    }
    return out;
}
```

(The ratio trick preserves the engine's `colour = texture × tint × AO`: dividing the blended texel by the native one cancels the texture content, leaving only the blur factor to multiply back into `surface.colour`. White reads — texture-less faces — make the guard skip the effect.)

### Where the texture API can't go

- **Not callable from vertex hooks** — "reaches" diagnostics reject it
- **You cannot add textures** — the atlas is the engine's; the API only reads it. Custom textures remain the texture-pack system's job
- **Non-atlas renderer configurations degrade to stubs** — `bloxdTextureSize() -> vec2u(1u)` and `bloxdTexel(...) -> vec4f(1.0)`, with the four inputs flowing `0u, 0u, vec2f(0.0), 0.0`. Code written for the real atlas still compiles and runs — it just sees white texels and a 1×1 size. Code that tolerates `textureId == 0` tolerates this too

## Constants

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored verbatim from the live header)

The header provides three constants (texture name constants `bloxdTextureId*` are covered in [Texture API](texture-api.md)).

```wgsl
const bloxdPi: f32 = 3.1415926535898;
const bloxdTau: f32 = 6.2831853071796;

// Blocks along each side of a chunk.
const bloxdChunkSize: i32 = 32;
```

| Constant | Type | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bloxdPi` | `f32` | 3.1415926535898 | pi |
| `bloxdTau` | `f32` | 6.2831853071796 | 2π (handy for periods) |
| `bloxdChunkSize` | `i32` | 32 | blocks along each side of a chunk (**new in v5**) |

### Usage

#### bloxdPi / bloxdTau

Declared for you — no need to define your own pi. `bloxdTau` is convenient for periodic animation:

```wgsl
fn sway(worldPos: vec3f, time: f32) -> f32 {
    let phase = dot(worldPos, vec3f(1.0, 0.5, 0.8));
    return sin(time * bloxdTau / 3.0 + phase);
}
```

#### bloxdChunkSize — new in v5

The engine's former magic number "chunks are 32 blocks wide" is now a named constant you can branch on. Useful for chunk-periodic effects (checkerboards, chunk-border accents):

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
    let p = bloxdWorldPosition(light.position);
    let chunk = floor(p / f32(bloxdChunkSize));
    let parity = (chunk.x + chunk.z) % 2.0;
    out.colour *= mix(1.0, 0.96, parity);
    return out;
}
```

Note: `bloxdChunkSize` is `i32` — cast with `f32(bloxdChunkSize)` when mixing with floats.

## Preprocessor

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored from the live validator)

Conditional compilation supports only `#define NAME` (no value) / `#ifdef` / `#ifndef` / `#else` / `#endif`. The `#` goes at the start of a line (inside functions is fine). Flag-name matching is case-insensitive; a wrong `#ifdef` name makes the error message list the official set.

### Defined macros (3)

| Macro | Defined in | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOXD_STRICT` | strict-game variants (strict.terrain / strict.liquid / strict.model) | `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` around whole vertex hooks and `discard` |
| `BLOXD_ALPHA` | variants where `BloxdSurface.alpha` exists — all liquid + non-strict terrain/model | wrap alpha-touching code |
| `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` | all liquid variants | wrap `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` calls |

### Macro × variant matrix

| Variant | `BLOXD_STRICT` | `BLOXD_ALPHA` | `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `allow.terrain` | – | ✓ | – |
| `allow.liquid` | – | ✓ | ✓ |
| `allow.model` | – | ✓ | – |
| `strict.terrain` | ✓ | – | – |
| `strict.liquid` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `strict.model` | ✓ | – | – |

Terrain / liquid / model differences are **separate programs, not macros** — `#ifdef BLOXD_TERRAIN` does not exist.

### Removed macros

- **`BLOXD_LIGHTING`** — removed in v5. Lighting state is a runtime question for [`bloxdLit()`](lighting.md#bloxdlit--the-gate), not a compile branch. Using it fails validation with:

> *"BLOXD_LIGHTING was removed in apiVersion 5; test bloxdLit() in code instead."*

v4 migration pattern:

```wgsl
// v4 (fails validation on v5)
#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight { ... }
#endif

// v5 (migrated)
fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    if (!bloxdLit()) { return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light); }
    // ... lighting-enabled processing
}
```

### Example

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    out.colour = out.colour * vec3f(1.0, 0.9, 0.8);
    #ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA                          // terrain has alpha only in allow
    out.alpha = s.alpha;
    #endif
    return out;
}

#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT                            // vertex hooks always need this guard
fn bloxdTerrainVertex(v: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    var out = bloxdDefaultVertex(v);
    out.position.y += sin(bloxdSeconds()) * 0.05;
    return out;
}
#endif
```

### Macros shape the structs

- `BloxdSurface.alpha` exists only inside `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA`
- `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` is callable only inside `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH`

## Restrictions & reserved names

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Verified (v4 limits re-confirmed byte-identical on v5)

What packs may write, and the complete name-reservation rules.

### Allowed

- WGSL built-ins (`sin`, `mix`, `clamp`, `distance`, `smoothstep`, `reflect`, `select`, …)
- your own `fn` / `struct` / `const` / `alias` / `var<private>`, in-function `let` and control flow (if/for/while/switch…)
- derivatives (`dpdx` / `dpdy` / `fwidth`) in surface/light hooks (fragment stage) only — not in vertex hooks
- `const` arrays (color LUTs etc.), pointers (`ptr<function, T>`), matrices (`mat3x3f` etc.)
- flag definitions `#define NAME` (no value) + `#ifdef` conditionals

### Forbidden / caveats

- **No direct textures**: you cannot declare `texture_*` / `sampler` types; atlas reads go through [`bloxdTexel`](texture-api.md) only. *"Packs can't use X: the engine binds every texture and sampler. Surface and light hooks can read atlas textures with bloxdTexel."*
- **`discard` is forbidden in strict** — wrap in `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT`
- `@attributes` / `enable` / `requires` / `override` are forbidden — no `enable f16;`, so **no f16 types**
- no `@builtin`, so `fragCoord` / `vertex_index` are unreachable
- **no module-scope `let`** — use `const` or `var`
- no `atomic`
- **never construct output structs directly**: `BloxdLight(...)` fails static validation; start from `bloxdDefault*`
- a bare `var x: BloxdSurface;` is a validation error
- hook parameters are read-only — copy before mutating
- `#define` takes no value (names only)

### Reserved names

#### The bloxd prefix (general rule)

**Every identifier matching `/^bloxd/i` (case-insensitive) is reserved.** The only exceptions are the 9 hook function names.

Validator wording, verbatim:

> *"Packs can't declare names starting with bloxd, other than the hook functions bloxd<Terrain|Liquid|Model><Vertex|Surface|Light>"*

#### The bloxdSp* namespace (46 symbols)

Symbols the code generator may inject and therefore cannot be redeclared (grown from 27 to 46 in v5):

`bloxdSpAcross` · `bloxdSpAt` · `bloxdSpBehind` · `bloxdSpCell` · `bloxdSpCellAt` · `bloxdSpCellIndex` · `bloxdSpColour` · `bloxdSpDdx` · `bloxdSpDdy` · `bloxdSpDown` · `bloxdSpEnchant` · `bloxdSpEye` · `bloxdSpFlags` · `bloxdSpFrame` · `bloxdSpIndex` · `bloxdSpInside` · `bloxdSpItemLocalPosition` · `bloxdSpLayer` · `bloxdSpLevel` · `bloxdSpLight` · `bloxdSpLightIn` · `bloxdSpLod` · `bloxdSpMipLevel` · `bloxdSpNormal` · `bloxdSpOut` · `bloxdSpOwnTexel` · `bloxdSpPixel` · `bloxdSpPosition` · `bloxdSpPositionW` · `bloxdSpQuarterTurns` · `bloxdSpScale` · `bloxdSpSceneDepth` · `bloxdSpSize` · `bloxdSpSurface` · `bloxdSpSurfaceIn` · `bloxdSpTexelUV` · `bloxdSpTexture` · `bloxdSpTextureId` · `bloxdSpTextureLayers` · `bloxdSpTextureRotation` · `bloxdSpTurned` · `bloxdSpUv` · `bloxdSpVertex` · `bloxdSpVertexIn` · `bloxdSpWord` · `bloxdSpZ`

The new names map directly to v5 features: `bloxdSpFlags` (flag struct delivery), `bloxdSpEnchant` / `bloxdSpItemLocalPosition` (new inputs), the cell-sampling texture-pack path, the rotation chain, and extended-hook locals. **The pack-level reservation rule is broader than this list** (everything matching `/^bloxd/i`), so you don't need to memorize it — just never start your own names with `bloxd`.

#### Texture names

Identifiers starting `bloxdTextureId` are resolved as texture-name constants ([Texture API](texture-api.md#bloxdtextureid-named-texture-constants)).

### Auto-rewrite introduced in v5

- **Y-derivative sign flip**: the analyzer rewrites every call to `dpdy`, `dpdyCoarse` and `dpdyFine` as `(-dpdy(...))` (measured in the validator's token-rewrite pass; the dpdy family is explicitly enumerated as the inversion set). Screen-space y points down, so this inversion makes "rate of change upward" match intuition. Write `dpdy(h)` with the intent "how does h change as I go up" and the emitted code carries the flip. `dpdx` and the `fwidth` family are untouched

### Diagnostics you'll actually see

- *"Packs can't declare names starting with bloxd, other than the hook functions bloxd<Terrain|Liquid|Model><Vertex|Surface|Light>"*
- *"Packs can't use X: the engine binds every texture and sampler. Surface and light hooks can read atlas textures with bloxdTexel."*
- *"X reaches bloxdTexel, which only surface and light hooks can use."*
- *"X reaches bloxdOpaqueBehind, which needs BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH, and Y doesn't define it; in code other programs' hooks share, guard the call with #ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH."*
- *"BLOXD_LIGHTING was removed in apiVersion 5; test bloxdLit() in code instead."*

## Compatibility

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified

How the current game and old-version packs interoperate.

### Accepted versions

**Only `apiVersion: 5`.** The loader compares `manifest.apiVersion !== 5` strictly and v1/v2/v3/v4 packs **fail at the instant of load**. No multi-version acceptance exists.

### Load-time messages (verbatim from the live i18n dictionary)

- `pack.json needs "apiVersion": {{version}}.` — the `apiVersion` key is missing
- `This pack is shader pack API version {{packVersion}}. Bloxd supports version {{version}}.` — the key exists but isn't 5

### Saved old packs (no exceptions — silent inactivation)

Previously-saved v1–v4 packs don't throw. The saved-pack result resolves to:

```
{kind: "none", reason: "otherApiVersion"}
```

and the pack becomes **silently inactive**. Only the shader-pack settings tab explains why:

> `This shader pack is for API version {{packVersion}}, so it won't run. Load a version {{version}} pack to replace it.`

### The nature of the v4 → v5 conversion

The conversion is mostly mechanical (full checklist in [the v5 migration guide](../history/v5.md)):

- `blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagX != 0u` → `flags.x` (a 1:1 rename)
- `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` → `if (bloxdLit()) { ... } else { return bloxdDefaultLight(...); }`
- delete `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition` call sites (no replacement)
- bump `pack.json` to `"apiVersion": 5`

The quiet trap this time: packs that keep reading `blockFlags` or wrapping light hooks in `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` **fail validation with dedicated messages** (the analyzer now explains both cases), so nothing misbehaves silently — they just stay refused until migrated.

### Saved-pack re-validation ("needs re-check")

`HEADER_VERSION` is `9.<fnv1a32(header)>.<fnv1a32(texture registry)>` (the leading integer went from v4's 8 to 9). When the engine's header or texture registry changes (common with game updates), saved packs are marked "needs re-check" and re-validate automatically on page load.

A measured example of registry movement (two builds, 10 days apart): entries 1200 → 1219 (98 added, 79 removed), and of the names that kept their spelling, **779 of 1121 changed id**. In other words:

- **packs written with names (`bloxdTextureIdLava`) survive drift** (the loader re-resolves against the live registry)
- **packs written with raw ids (`19`) break on re-validation**

Details: [Engine Internals: Texture Registry](../internals/texture-registry.md).

### Runtime environments

- **WebGPU-renderer only**: installing a pack force-enables the WebGPU renderer
- **Mobile**: WebGPU-limited environments can't run packs at all ([Requirements](../getting-started/requirements.md))
- **Non-atlas renderer configurations**: `bloxdTexel` / `bloxdTextureSize` degrade to stubs (white texels, 1×1); code still compiles and runs ([Texture API](texture-api.md#where-the-texture-api-cant-go))

### Version support summary

| API version | Live since | Treatment by the current game |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | — | rejected at load (migrate via [v2](../history/v2.md)) |
| v2 | — | rejected at load |
| v3 | 2026-10-19 | rejected at load |
| v4 | 2026-10-26 | rejected at load |
| **v5** | **2026-11-03** | **current** |

## Texture catalog

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified (extracted by re-running the engine's own registry builder)

The complete catalog of usable texture-name constants (`bloxdTextureId*`). **896 names**, alphabetical.

### How to read

The **name** column is the registry name — the handle you actually write. Constant spelling CamelCases the file name: `grass_top` → `bloxdTextureIdGrassTop`, `lava` → `bloxdTextureIdLava`. **Case and underscores are not distinguished** (`bloxdTextureId_grass_top` resolves identically to `bloxdTextureIdGrassTop`). Names are the API — the loader re-resolves them against the live registry at load, so names survive registry drift ([Texture API](texture-api.md)).

The **id** column is the value the constant compares against — measured on `ab90qa` (atlas layer + 1). Use it to decode `surface.textureId` dumps and to cross-check debug output against the day's build. **Never write ids into WGSL** — they are a snapshot of one build's atlas order (see the drift measurements below).

The **notes** column marks the two folding families. "anim (N frames)" means sampling this name automatically returns the current animation frame — **never write the frame suffix** (`lava0` is a known alias with a dedicated diagnostic). "rotation family (4 copies)" means the texture exists only as pre-rotated slots — the name refers to the root and `bloxdTexel` re-applies the rotation. Exactly one name (`radar_screen`) carries both notes.

Deliberately **not** listed: the remaining registry spellings — 188 frame aliases and 228 rotation aliases — which are not usable constants; writing them draws dedicated engine error messages. The underlying 1,210-row layer table (including 171 pre-rotated slots) is engine-internal and covered in [Engine Internals: Texture Registry](../internals/texture-registry.md).

### The catalog

All usable names, alphabetically. The id column is the `bloxdTextureId*` value — measured on `ab90qa` (2026-11-03). **Ids are snapshots; treat names as the API**: even between the v4 build (cnty9) and this build, 334 of the names that kept their spelling changed id (see the drift measurements below).

#### Rotation families (57 roots)

These textures exist only as pre-rotated copies (`name[rot[1..4`). The registry folds them to the root below, and `bloxdTexel` re-applies the rotation at sample time — reference the root, never the copies. Writing a `[rot[N` spelling draws the dedicated rotation diagnostic.

#### Animation families (42 names)

Sampling these names automatically returns the current animation frame. The engine advances frames at a fixed interval per family — measured values are only 3: **200 ms** (3 families), **250 ms** (21 families), **300 ms** (18 families). Packs never write frame suffixes (`lava0` is an error; `lava` is the name).

|---|---|---|
| `alloy_kiln_side_running` | 4 | 250 ms |
| `auto_bench_side_running` | 4 | 250 ms |

Structural note visible in the raw data: the atlas holds 45 animation roots, not 42 — `radar_screen`'s four pre-rotated copies each carry their own 4-frame ladder, which is also why `radar_screen` is the only name carrying both family notes.

### Measured drift (cnty9 → ab90qa)

The registry is build-shipped content and moves with every block update. v4 build (`cnty9`, 2026-10-27) → v5 build (`ab90qa`, 2026-11-03):

- atlas entries: 1,219 → 1,210
- rotation families (turned spellings): 57 (228) → 57 (228) — **unchanged**
- animation families (frame spellings): 42 (188) → 42 (188) — **unchanged**
- usable named constants: 905 → **896**
- id changes among surviving names: **334 of 905**

The complete drift (11 names):

- **added (1):** `scorpion_eggs`.
- **removed (10):** `chest_double_back_hi`, `chest_double_back_lo`, `chest_double_front_hi`, `chest_double_front_lo`, `chest_double_top_1_hi`, `chest_double_top_1_lo`, `chest_double_top_2_hi`, `chest_double_top_2_lo`, `mob_spawner_hostile_block_side`, `mob_spawner_neutral_block_side` — the double chest (8 faces) left the game data (the single-chest `chest_*` family survives intact), and spawners keep `mob_spawner_block_top` while the variant side textures are gone.

**Names are the API; ids are snapshots.** Between the two builds, 334 of 905 surviving names changed id — write `bloxdTextureIdStone`, not `351`. The engine resolves names at validation, so name-written packs survive drift; raw-id packs do not.

### Where errors appear

1. **Settings → Shader Pack status line** — loader-stage errors (IDs are `shaderPack:load*`)
2. **The loader screen's error list** — validation & compilation (file:line + variant)
3. **Browser devtools console** — runtime & stage-2 (browser WGSL compiler) errors

The 3-stage load check is detailed in [Getting Started: Validation](../getting-started/validation.md).

---

## Loading errors

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

Errors rejected at the **loader stage** (the first gate), shown in the settings status line with `shaderPack:load*` IDs.

### "There's no pack.json at the top of the pack."

- **Cause**: no `pack.json` at the zip root (e.g. the folder was zipped with an extra nesting level)
- **Check**: open the zip — `pack.json` at the top level (or directly under one common root folder)
- **Fix**: zip `pack.json` and the `.wgsl` files directly. A single common root folder is stripped automatically ([Pack structure](../getting-started/pack-structure.md))
- **Prevention**: keep your zipping procedure fixed; macOS "Compress" works as-is (OS junk is auto-excluded)

### `loadDuplicateManifest` on zip load

- **Cause**: two `pack.json` files (including case differences)
- **Fix**: keep exactly one

### Size & count limits

| Message | Limit |
|---|---|
| `The zip is over 32 MB.` | zip 32 MB |
| `The zip has more than 1024 entries.` | 1,024 entries |
| `The pack has more than 256 .wgsl files.` | 256 `.wgsl` files |
| `The pack's .wgsl files are over 256 KB in total.` | 256 KB total |
| `pack.json is over 64 KB.` | 64 KB manifest |

- **Fix**: drop unneeded `.wgsl` files / merge files / trim comments
- **Prevention**: these limits are also practical compile-time ceilings — treat growth as a refactoring signal

### Format problems

Split zips, zip64, encrypted entries and unsupported compression are each rejected with dedicated messages. All files must be valid UTF-8.

### Loader error-ID reference

| ID | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `loadZipTooBig` | zip over 32MB |
| `loadTooManyZipEntries` | over 1024 entries |
| `loadTooManyWgsl` | over 256 `.wgsl` |
| `loadSourceTooBig` | over 256KB total (streamed per-file check) |
| `loadManifestTooBig` | `pack.json` over 64KB |
| `loadManifestNotJson` / `loadManifestNotObject` | not JSON / not an object |
| `loadNoApiVersion` / `loadWrongApiVersion` | missing / not `5` ([API version errors](api-version.md)) |
| `loadNoName` / `loadAuthorNotString` | missing `name` / non-string `author` |
| `loadUnsupportedCompression` / `loadZip64` / `loadSplitZip` / `loadEncrypted` | unsupported compression / zip64 / split / encrypted |
| `loadDuplicatePath` / `loadNotUtf8` / `loadDecompressFailed` / `loadZipDamaged` | duplicate path / non-UTF-8 / decompress failure / damaged zip |
| `loadNoManifest` / `loadDuplicateManifest` | manifest position / duplication |

### "Ready. Reload the page to use it." but nothing changes

- **Cause**: packs need a **page reload** to activate
- **Fix**: reload after selecting; status should become `Ready to use`
- **Note**: leftover renderer overrides (`?renderer=`, localStorage `bloxdRenderer`) make packs refuse to start — clear them and reload

## API version errors

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified (verbatim from the live i18n dictionary)

Errors around `apiVersion`. The current game accepts **only `5`**.

### "pack.json needs "apiVersion": {{version}}."

- **Symptom**: this message right after load (`loadNoApiVersion`)
- **Cause**: the `apiVersion` key is missing entirely
- **Fix**: add `"apiVersion": 5` — a **number** (the string `"5"` fails)
- **Prevention**: start from the [pack.json](../getting-started/manifest.md) template

### "This pack is shader pack API version {{packVersion}}. Bloxd supports version {{version}}."

- **Symptom**: `loadWrongApiVersion`
- **Cause**: `apiVersion` exists but isn't 5 (a v1–v4 pack)
- **Fix**: apply the matching migration ([Version History](../history/)):
  - v4 → v5: [the v5 guide](../history/v5.md) — mostly mechanical (flags · `bloxdLit()` · removing `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition`)
  - v3 → v5: apply [v4](../history/v4.md) first
  - v2 or earlier → v5: step through v3 → v4 → v5
- **Prevention**: after any API update, check [Compatibility](../api/compatibility.md) and the matching migration guide

### The string "5" is rejected

- **Cause**: the loader compares `manifest.apiVersion !== 5` **strictly** (`===`); a JSON string `"5"` is not the number 5
- **Fix**: `"apiVersion": 5` (unquoted)

### A saved old pack silently stopped working

- **Symptom**: a previously-working v1–v4 pack is unresponsive, with no exception
- **Cause**: saved packs resolve to `{kind: "none", reason: "otherApiVersion"}` and become **silently inactive**
- **Check**: the settings-tab status line: `This shader pack is for API version {{packVersion}}, so it won't run. Load a version {{version}} pack to replace it.`
- **Fix**: load a migrated replacement from the same screen
- **Prevention**: after API updates, re-release a bumped version and announce it ([Distribution](../getting-started/distribution.md))

### A migrated v4 pack fails validation

The three typical patterns (full steps in the [v5 migration guide](../history/v5.md)):

| Validation message | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOXD_LIGHTING was removed in apiVersion 5; test bloxdLit() in code instead.` | `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` usage | rewrite as `if (bloxdLit()) { ... } else { return bloxdDefaultLight(s, l); }` |
| `bloxdBlockFlagRock isn't part of the shader pack API...` (reserved-name diagnostic) | leftover bit-constant references | use `surface.flags.rock` etc. (1:1 table in [Flags](../api/flags.md)) |
| `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition` missing | removed in v5 | delete call sites (no replacement — use `flags`) |

## Compilation errors

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

Errors that pass static validation but fail as WGSL, or fail only in the browser's WGSL compiler (stage 2).

### "bloxdTerrainVertex must be declared as: fn ..."

- **Cause**: hook signature mismatch (argument/return types)
- **Fix**: rewrite to the declaration shown in the message (parameter names are free; types must match exactly)
- **Prevention**: start from the [hook comparison table](../api/hooks.md)

### "mixing '*' and '^' requires parenthesis (only in ...)"

- **Cause**: WGSL requires parentheses when mixing `^` `&` `|` `<<` `>>` with other operators
- **Fix**: parenthesize the operands

### "... can only be a function's parameter or return type, ..."

- **Cause**: `var x: BloxdSurface;` — bare type-annotated declarations are rejected because header structs gain fields
- **Fix**: `var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);` (or `var out = s;` in light hooks)
- **Prevention**: always build outputs from `bloxdDefault*` ([conventions](../api/structures.md#writing-conventions-recap))

### "_ can only be the target of a phony assignment, as in _ = f();"

- **Cause**: `let _ = f();` is invalid WGSL
- **Fix**: write `_ = f();`

### "Lite: …reads scene depth on a page that didn't turn it on"

- **Cause**: a depth-reading pack (`bloxdOpaqueBehind`) was active when the page was generated; depth availability is decided at page generation
- **Fix**: reload the page with the pack active

### dpdy sign looks inverted

- **This is by design**: v5's analyzer auto-rewrites every `dpdy` / `dpdyCoarse` / `dpdyFine` call to `(-dpdy(...))` (screen-space y points down)
- **Fix**: nothing — write `dpdy(h)` with the intent "how does h change going up" and the emitted code carries the flip ([Restrictions](../api/restrictions.md#auto-rewrite-introduced-in-v5))
- `dpdx` and `fwidth` are untouched

### Pack gets dropped on game join / the on-device check never finishes

- **Cause**: the on-device check failed, or hit the 60-second forced timeout (`skipped`) — common on low-spec devices and heavy worlds
- **Fix**: reduce heavy vertex work and complex loops; see [Performance](performance.md)

## Validation errors

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified (messages recorded verbatim from the live validator)

Static-validation (analyzer, stage 1) errors — mostly reserved names, the strict contract, and cross-hook call restrictions.

### "Packs can't construct BloxdSurface directly" / "Packs can't construct BloxdLight directly, since header structs gain fields; ..."

- **Cause**: calling constructors like `BloxdSurface(...)`
- **Fix**: start from `bloxdDefaultSurface(s)` / `bloxdDefaultLight(s, l)` and mutate fields (`var out = s;` works in light hooks)

### "Packs can't declare names starting with bloxd, other than the hook functions bloxd<Terrain|Liquid|Model><Vertex|Surface|Light>"

- **Cause**: an identifier starting with `bloxd` (case-insensitive)
- **Fix**: rename (e.g. `packTint`). Only the 9 hook names are allowed
- **Prevention**: prefix your own names with `pack` / `my` etc.

### "bloxdPackInputs isn't part of the bloxd_ header"

- **Cause**: referencing the uniform directly
- **Fix**: use it via the header functions ([Pack format](../api/pack-format.md#per-frame-uniform-bloxdpackinputs))

### "... reaches bloxdTexel, which only surface and light hooks can use."

- **Cause**: called from a vertex hook (or a function reachable from one) — "reaches" means **the call path**
- **Fix**: move the call to a surface / light hook

### "... reaches bloxdOpaqueBehind, which needs BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH, and <program> doesn't define it; ..."

- **Cause**: `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` needs `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH`, defined only in all-liquid variants; sharing the call from terrain/model-hook code creates uncompilable variants
- **Fix**: wrap the call in `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH`
- **Prevention**: isolate depth reads as liquid-only processing

### The strict contract

| Message | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `<hook> moves terrain, which strict games prevent.` | unguarded vertex hook |
| `discard makes terrain see-through, which strict games prevent.` | reachable `discard` |

- **Important**: these are not compile errors — strict games **auto-disable the whole pack** (`shaderPack:offInStrict`)
- **Fix**: wrap vertex hooks and `discard` in `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` ([Variants](../getting-started/variants.md))

### v5 additions/changes

| Message | Action |
|---|---|
| `BLOXD_LIGHTING was removed in apiVersion 5; test bloxdLit() in code instead.` | migrate `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` → `if (bloxdLit())` ([Lighting](../api/lighting.md#bloxdlit--the-gate)) |
| `bloxdBlockFlagRock isn't part of the shader pack API...` | leftover bit constant → `flags.rock` ([Flags](../api/flags.md)) |
| `bloxdSpLitColour isn't part of the shader pack API...` | v4 internal symbol → use the public `bloxdLitColour()` |

v5's analyzer gives **dedicated messages** to packs that keep reading `blockFlags` or wrapping light hooks in `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING`, so nothing misbehaves silently ([v5 migration](../history/v5.md)).

Texture-name resolution errors (spelling suggestions, frame/rotation spellings) live in [Texture issues](textures.md).

## Variant-specific issues

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

Problems that occur in only some of the 6 variants (`strict|allow` × `terrain|liquid|model`). v5 removed the lighting axis (the old `BLOXD_LIGHTING`) and the loader validates **all 6 variants at once** on load.

### Loads only in non-strict games / dropped in strict

- **Cause**: an unguarded vertex hook or a reachable `discard`; strict games forbid both and violate = **whole-pack auto-disable** (`shaderPack:offInStrict`)
- **Check**: the loader screen shows `<hook> moves terrain, which strict games prevent.` / `discard makes terrain see-through, which strict games prevent.`
- **Fix**: wrap vertex hooks and `discard` in `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT`
- **Prevention**: always start vertex hooks from the guarded template ([Variants](../getting-started/variants.md))

### ".alpha is undefined"

- **Cause**: `alpha` exists only behind `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA` (all liquid + non-strict terrain/model)
- **Fix**: wrap alpha-touching code in `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA` ([Preprocessor](../api/preprocessor.md#macro--variant-matrix))

### "BloxdVertex only exists when BLOXD_STRICT isn't defined"

- **Cause**: strict variants have no vertex hooks at all, so no `BloxdVertex` either; vertex code is reachable from strict variants
- **Fix**: guard the vertex hook

### bloxdOpaqueBehind fails in only some variants

- **Cause**: `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` is defined only in all-liquid variants
- **Fix**: `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` ([Validation errors](validation.md))

### Water ignores the pack (Liquid)

- **Symptom**: terrain hooks written, water unchanged
- **Cause**: **in v5, if a pack defines no Liquid hook, no Terrain hook runs on water either** (the pre-v4 "liquid falls back to terrain" behavior is gone)
- **Fix**: write Liquid hooks ([hook split](../api/hooks.md#what-each-program-draws))

### Models (entities, block models) unaffected

- **Cause**: out of scope before v5; now requires `bloxdModel*` hooks
- **Fix**: define `bloxdModelSurface` / `bloxdModelLight` ([Models guide](../guides/models.md))

### About the 6-variant validation

The loader validates **all 6 variants at once** at load (the lighting axis is no longer compiled separately). Even if a game uses only some conditions, distributed packs must anticipate all six.

| Variant | Macros defined |
|---|---|
| `allow.terrain` | `BLOXD_ALPHA` |
| `allow.liquid` | `BLOXD_ALPHA` · `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` |
| `allow.model` | `BLOXD_ALPHA` |
| `strict.terrain` | — |
| `strict.liquid` | `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` |
| `strict.model` | — |

## Visual issues

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

Compiles fine but looks wrong.

### Distance turns white/hazy

- **Cause**: double fog. The default light-hook output is **already fogged** (`bloxdApplyFog(lit + emission, light)`), so mixing more fog color on top doubles it
- **Fix**: keep custom fog subtle; consider saturation-only aerial perspective ([realism recipes](../recipes/realism.md))
- **Prevention**: understand `fogAlpha` semantics (0 = no fog, 1 = only fogColour) and the [pipeline](../api/lighting.md#the-full-pipeline) before writing fog

### pow(l.skyLight, γ) never darkens shadows

- **Cause**: `skyLight` arrives post-lift-curve (raw 0.87 arrives as 0.97); gamma mathematically cannot compete
- **Fix**: switch to lift inversion + threshold ([Shadows](../guides/shadows.md))

### Blocks turn almost pure white

- **Cause**: the light-hook output exceeds 1.0 (no clamp exists past the output)
- **Fix**: append `clamp(col, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0))`

### White without additions

- **Cause**: un-fog inversion by division
- **Fix**: drop the un-fog; rebuild from `s.colour` and apply fog exactly once at the end (or via `bloxdApplyFog`)

### Glowing blocks don't glow (rebuilding packs)

- **Cause**: missing emission re-add — dropping the default output means adding emission yourself
- **Fix**: add `+ s.emission * (1.0 - l.fogAlpha)`; on v5 the `bloxdLitColour()` + emission + `bloxdApplyFog` composition is safest ([Lighting](../api/lighting.md))

### Waves/patterns cut off at chunk or origin switches

- **Cause**: using render-space positions directly — the origin moves with the player
- **Fix**: use `bloxdWorldPosition(position)` for world-dependent effects ([Coordinates](../recipes/coordinates.md)); note f32 precision limits far from origin

### Water-surface patterns misalign on rotated faces

- **Cause**: `bloxdTexel` applies the fragment's own `textureRotation` to your uv ([the rotation subtlety](../api/texture-api.md#the-rotation-subtlety--a-neutral-sampler))
- **Fix**: pre-rotate with the `texelNeutral` helper

### Enchant glint / hurt flash disappeared

- **Cause**: custom lighting rebuilt without passing `enchantColour` / `overlayColour` through
- **Fix**: pass them through or use `bloxdLitColour()` ([Enchant effects](../recipes/enchant-effects.md))
- **v5**: `bloxdDefaultSurface` passes both through unchanged, so defaults never lose them

### Sky, clouds or the sun disc unaffected

- **By design**: hooks cover terrain / liquid / model only ([Unreachable effects](../guides/constraints.md))

## Texture issues

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Verified (messages recorded verbatim from the live validator)

Problems around `bloxdTextureId*` / `bloxdTexel`. Search all 896 names in the [texture catalog](../api/texture-catalog.md).

### "There's no texture called X. Did you mean bloxdTextureIdY?"

- **Cause**: a misspelling; v5's validator has **Levenshtein suggestions** (threshold `max(2, floor(len/4)) + 1`)
- **Fix**: accept the suggestion; cross-check the [catalog](../api/texture-catalog.md)
- **Prevention**: copy-paste names from the catalog

### "...names a frame of the animated texture lava: use bloxdTextureIdLava, which bloxdTexel animates."

- **Cause**: writing a **frame number** on an animated texture (`lava0` etc.)
- **Fix**: use the base name — sampling returns the current frame automatically
- **Prevention**: never write frame suffixes for the 42 animation families ([naming](../api/texture-api.md#spelling-rules-and-naming-freedom))

### "...names a turned copy of radar_screen0: use bloxdTextureIdRadarScreen0, ..."

- **Cause**: writing a rotation-family turned-copy spelling (`[rot[N`)
- **Fix**: use the root name — `bloxdTexel` re-applies the rotation

### "...could name X and Y, which differ only by case or underscores, so it can't be used."

- **Cause**: the case/underscore-insensitive fold left the name **ambiguous**
- **Fix**: disambiguate the spelling

### "bloxdTextureIdGrassTop isn't part of the shader pack API. Texture names start with exactly bloxdTextureId: did you mean bloxdTextureIdGrassTop?"

- **Cause**: prefix misspelling (e.g. `bloxdTextureID`, `bloxdtextureid`)
- **Fix**: start names with exactly `bloxdTextureId`

### "Case and underscores are not distinguished" — how do both rules coexist?

Name resolution folds case and `_`, so `bloxdTextureId_grass_top` and `bloxdTextureIdGrassTop` resolve to the **same** constant. Only when the fold leaves multiple candidates does the dedicated ambiguity error fire ([naming rules](../api/texture-api.md#spelling-rules-and-naming-freedom)).

### bloxdTexel always returns white on models

- **By design**: most models use `textureId: 0` (no texture — player skins etc.); `bloxdTexel(0, ...)` returns `vec4f(1.0)`
- **Fix**: select with `surface.textureId != 0u` ([model-owned textures](../api/texture-api.md#model-owned-textures-textureid-0))

### Wanting to add textures

- **Limit**: the shader-pack API only **reads** the atlas; adding textures is the texture-pack system's job ([combinations](../guides/combinations.md))

### "Packs can't use X: the engine binds every texture and sampler..."

- **Cause**: declaring `texture_*` / `sampler` types directly
- **Fix**: go through `bloxdTexel()` ([Restrictions](../api/restrictions.md))

### Raw ids broke after a game update

- **Cause**: **ids are snapshots** — measured, 334 of 905 surviving names changed id between two builds
- **Fix**: write `bloxdTextureIdLava`, not `19` ([names are the API](../api/texture-catalog.md#measured-drift-cnty9--ab90qa))

## Lighting issues

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

Brightness, shadow and fog problems.

### Caves too bright

- **Cause**: insufficient non-linearity on `skyLight`
- **Fix**: the cave-darkening recipes in [lighting recipes](../recipes/lighting.md) and [realism recipes](../recipes/realism.md)

### Lit faces too bright at night

- **Cause**: only shadow colors were darkened — the finished color keeps its daytime brightness
- **Fix**: attenuate the whole finished color at night and relax only local light (`blockLight` / `heldLight`) — [the night guide](../guides/night.md)

### Night too dark

- **Fix**: guarantee a minimum ambient; with a zero `bloxdSunDirection()` the true moon direction is unknown, so use pseudo blue ambient ([the night recipe](../recipes/lighting.md)). The moon direction itself is `-bloxdSunDirection()` (day-night-cycle worlds only)

### Daytime blows out

- **Fix**: lower the exposure before ACES ([ACES](../recipes/realism.md))

### Torch surroundings saturated orange

- **Fix**: lower the warm blend ratio ([warm torch × cool sky](../recipes/realism.md))

### Want to keep the engine's world light exactly

- **v5 solution**: call `bloxdWorldLight(light)` — identical math to the engine's "brightest of block/sky/held, floored by ambientLightColour" ([Lighting](../api/lighting.md#bloxdworldlight--the-worlds-light))
- **Note**: `blockLight` / `heldLight` are 0 and sky-related fields are 1 when `!bloxdLit()` (header guarantee)

### Looks wrong in lighting-disabled games

- **Cause**: lighting-only inputs (`blockLight` etc.) used unguarded. v5 has no `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` — branch on **runtime `bloxdLit()`**
- **Fix**: early return `if (!bloxdLit()) { return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light); }` ([Lighting](../api/lighting.md#bloxdlit--the-gate))

### "LightEngine: block light seed queue overflow - lighting may be incomplete for this chunk"

- **Cause**: dense glowing-block regions overflow the light seed queue and the chunk's light computation is cut short. **Not pack-caused**, but light gaps near glowing clusters trace to this
- **Fix**: spread light sources in the world

### Want the theory?

- Shadows: [Shadows](../guides/shadows.md) (skyLight = voxel shadow map)
- Fog: [Engine Internals: Fog Internals](../internals/fog-internals.md)

## Model issues

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (new v5 territory)

Issues around the new v5 Model hooks.

### Players/mobs unaffected

- **Cause**: entities (players, mobs, NPCs, armour, cosmetics) are drawn by the **Model program** — terrain hooks don't touch them
- **Fix**: add Model hooks ([the models guide](../guides/models.md))

### Slabs, stairs, plants unaffected

- **Cause**: block models (`slab` / `stairs` / `flat`) are also Model-program geometry, never terrain
- **Fix**: use Model hooks with `flags.slab` / `flags.stairs` / `flags.flat` ([Flags](../api/flags.md))

### Water unaffected

- **Cause**: water is Liquid-hook-only; **without Liquid hooks, no Terrain hook runs on water either** (v5 change)
- **Fix**: define `bloxdLiquidSurface` / `bloxdLiquidLight` ([Variant issues](variants.md))

### Want to change only held items but everything changes

- **Fix**: select with `surface.flags.held` ([model shader recipes](../recipes/model-shaders.md))

### Flag checks don't behave

- **Likely causes**:
  1. **treating flags as a single-choice enum** — they combine freely («sandstone is sand and rock», «possibly even none») ([Flags](../api/flags.md#flags-combine-freely))
  2. reading `else` as "everything else" — the else of `flags.rock` is merely "not rock", possibly still sand
- **Fix**: combine material flags (`opaque`…) independently of shape/state flags (`slab`/`held`…)

### Enchant glint disappeared

- **Fix**: pass `enchantColour` through or use `bloxdLitColour()` ([Enchant effects](../recipes/enchant-effects.md))

### Hurt flash disappeared / too strong

- **Fix**: pass `overlayColour` through or adjust `out.overlayColour.a` ([Enchant effects](../recipes/enchant-effects.md))

### localPosition always reads 0

- **By design**: `localPosition` is `vec3f(0.0)` on terrain and liquid faces — **no model there**
- **Fix**: read it in Model hooks ([model recipes](../recipes/model-shaders.md))

### bloxdTexel returns white on models

- **By design**: `textureId: 0` (skins) samples as white
- **Fix**: select with `surface.textureId != 0u` or work from `surface.colour` ([Texture issues](textures.md))

### Want armour-only / cosmetics-only changes

- **Limit**: no flag says "armour"; `flags.lifeform` includes armour and cosmetics
- **Approximation**: combine with `localPosition` (placement) or the presence of `overlayColour` ([model recipes](../recipes/model-shaders.md))

## Performance

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

Speed problems and their fixes.

### The on-device check never finishes and drops the pack

- **Cause**: the check has a **60-second forced timeout** (excess is treated as `skipped`) — common on low-spec devices and heavy worlds
- **Fix**: reduce heavy vertex work and complex loops, then retry
- **Prevention**: follow the [performance guide](../guides/performance.md)

### Frame rate drops

- **Check**: compare FPS with and without the pack; measure terrain-heavy scenes and water separately
- **Typical causes**: heavy effects on every face unconditionally (no flag/distance selection); high-frequency hash noise; large `pow` exponents
- **Fixes** ([the guide](../guides/performance.md)):
  - gate effects to the faces that need them via `flags`
  - early-out by distance (`distance(surface.position, bloxdEyePosition())`)
  - sample one mip up for cheaper `bloxdTexel` reads
- **Prevention**: add detail incrementally and compare FPS ([testing](../guides/testing.md))

### Slow only on mobile

- **Cause**: packs run on the WebGPU renderer; mobile GPUs can be tens of times slower than desktop
- **Fix**: reduce effect strength/frequency, strengthen distance culling — or clearly mark mobile as unsupported ([Requirements](../getting-started/requirements.md))

### Approaching the 256 KB pack limit

- **Fix**: trim comments, factor shared code into functions, drop unused recipes ([Pack structure](../getting-started/pack-structure.md))

## FAQ & legal notes

> Status: Verified

### Frequently asked questions

#### Q. Are shader packs an official feature?

The shader-pack feature is accessible from the in-game UI and pack-making appears to be an intended activity. No public official documentation has been found, though — this guide is an unofficial, analysis-based document.

#### Q. Can packs do anything dangerous?

Packs are pure WGSL — **JS execution and network access are impossible by design**. Only code that passes validation and compilation runs ([Restrictions](../api/restrictions.md)).

#### Q. Which games do packs work in?

Most games run in strict mode (no vertex animation, no `discard`). Vertex animation works only in allow-listed games. The per-title list is in [Engine Internals: policy](../internals/policy.md).

#### Q. Do packs work on mobile?

Only on WebGPU-capable environments ([Requirements](../getting-started/requirements.md)).

#### Q. Can I ship my own textures?

Not in a shader pack (the atlas is read-only). That is the texture-pack system's job ([combinations](../guides/combinations.md)).

#### Q. Can I keep using an old-version pack?

The current game accepts only `apiVersion: 5`; older packs are silently deactivated ([Compatibility](../api/compatibility.md)). Migrate via [Version History](../history/).

#### Q. Will the API change again?

Engine internals may change with updates — every page names its target build. Saved packs re-validate automatically when the header or registry changes ([Compatibility](../api/compatibility.md#saved-pack-re-validation-needs-re-check)).

#### Q. What about "cinematic shader" distributions?

A community "cinematic shader" distribution we analyzed turned out to be a texture pack (128×128 textures, no `pack.json` / `.wgsl`). Most "shadowy shader-like" looks are texture-side craft ([combinations](../guides/combinations.md)).

### Legal & notes

- This is an unofficial guide and does not represent the developers' views. The API may change without notice
- Created with AI assistance; accuracy is not guaranteed. Verify against actual in-game behavior
- Measured values (texture ids etc.) are snapshots of specific builds and change between builds ([names are the API](../api/texture-catalog.md#measured-drift-cnty9--ab90qa))

## Version History

Changes, migration steps and removed APIs for v1 through v5. For migrating legacy packs and for the preserved per-era specifications.

### Timeline

| Version | Live since | Guide | Highlights |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | (initial) | [v1](v1.md) | first shader-pack API. 6 hooks (terrain/liquid × vertex/surface); `bloxdTime` / `bloxdOriginOffset` / `bloxdFaceBlock` / `engineColour` / `fogFactor` vocabulary |
| v2 | — | [v2](v2.md) | full identifier rename, `blockId`, `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` and `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` |
| v3 | 2026-10-19 | [v3](v3.md) | `blockId` → `blockFlags` bit flags, `bloxdPi` / `bloxdTau`, official liquid hooks, hook-invocation internals |
| v4 | 2026-10-26 | [v4](v4.md) | texture API (`bloxdTexel` / `bloxdTextureSize` / `bloxdTextureId*`), the strict contract, engine header & registry analysis |
| **v5** | **2026-11-03** | [v5](v5.md) | **current** — `BloxdFlags` struct (14 bools), Model hooks (9 total), the `bloxdLit()` / `bloxdLitColour()` lighting API, `localPosition`, enchant/overlay inputs & outputs, 6 variants |

### The shared preface

The current game accepts only `apiVersion: 5` and **old-version packs fail at the instant of load** (saved packs are silently deactivated — [Compatibility](../api/compatibility.md)). Each guide covers "previous → next". Crossing several versions? Apply them oldest-first.

### Fast path to a checklist

- v4 pack → [v5 guide](v5.md) §77 (mostly mechanical)
- v3 pack → [v4](v4.md) §61 → [v5](v5.md) §77
- v2 pack → [v3](v3.md) §47 → v4 → v5
- v1 pack → start at [v2](v2.md) §37

> For the current spec itself see [API Reference](../api/); for current-build internals see [Engine Internals](../internals/).

## API v1

> Status: **Historical** — the first era of the shader-pack mechanism. Every v1 pack is rejected by the current game.

v1 was the first shader-pack API. v2 renamed the identifiers wholesale ([v2 guide](v2.md) §32's table), so the main value of knowing v1 vocabulary is **reading old distributions and old community guides**.

### v1 vocabulary (renamed in v2)

| v1 | v2 onward |
|---|---|
| `bloxdTime()` | same (became `bloxdSeconds()` in v3) |
| `bloxdOriginOffset()` | same (became `bloxdRenderOffset()` in v3) |
| `bloxdFaceBlock(position, normal)` | same (removed in v3) |
| `fogFactor` | `fogVisibility` (became `fogAlpha` in v5, inverted) |
| `engineColour` | same (removed in v5 — restructured into `litColour` and `bloxdLitColour()`) |
| — | `blockId` (added in v2, became `blockFlags` in v3) |

Hooks were terrain / liquid × vertex / surface — **6 hooks**, no light hooks (light hooks only became part of the default template in v5). Block identification was texture-color guessing only; `blockId` / `blockFlags` / `flags` did not exist yet.

### Migrating v1 → v2

The wholesale rename means it is not a mechanical conversion. Read the [v2 migration guide](v2.md) from the top:

1. [§31 The fate of v1 packs](v2.md)
2. [§32 Identifier renames (the table)](v2.md)
3. [§33 Where removed fields moved](v2.md)
4. [§37 v1 → v2 checklist](v2.md)

Then apply v3 → v4 → v5 in order ([the fast path](index.md#fast-path-to-a-checklist)).

## Teil VIII: Migrationsleitfaden für API Version 2


Ziel-Build: `6qxffk.main.5912a15f.js` (Produktions-Deployment mit Stand 2026-10-16). Teile I bis VII dieses Leitfadens sind bereits auf v2-Standard umgeschrieben; dieser Teil VIII fasst die Migrationspunkte von v1 und die v2-Neuerungen zusammen. Die Code-Beispiele der Neuerungen haben die 8/8-Variantenprüfung des v2-Compilers und die Browser-WGSL-Compiler-Prüfung (Tint) (§38) bestanden, und die v2-Konvertierung bestehender Rezepte ist rein mechanischer Bezeichnerersatz: vor Verteilung unbedingt per In-Game-Kompilierung prüfen.

### 31. Das Schicksal von v1-Paketen (erst das Fazit)

Das Spiel verlangt, dass die `apiVersion` des Manifests **strikt 2** ist. V1-Pakete werden beim Laden mit `This pack is for shader pack API version 1. Bloxd supports version 2.` (i18n-Key `shaderPack:loadWrongApiVersion`) abgelehnt. Es gibt **keinen parallelen v1/v2-Support**. Außerdem prüft die Engine das `validation.headerVersion` gespeicherter Pakete (Hash des gesamten Headers) erneut: Der Mechanismus, der gespeicherte Pakete bei Engine-Updates automatisch „recheck-pflichtig" macht, ist derselbe wie in v1.

### 32. Komplettumbenennung der Bezeichner (Zuordnungstabelle)

In v2 wurde die Underscore-Benennung zu CamelCase vereinheitlicht. **Alte Namen sind durchweg unbrauchbar**.

| v1 | v2 |
|---|---|
| `bloxd_terrain_vertex` | `bloxdTerrainVertex` |
| `bloxd_terrain_surface` | `bloxdTerrainSurface` |
| `bloxd_terrain_light` | `bloxdTerrainLight` |
| `bloxd_liquid_vertex` | `bloxdLiquidVertex` |
| `bloxd_liquid_surface` | `bloxdLiquidSurface` |
| `bloxd_liquid_light` | `bloxdLiquidLight` |
| `bloxd_defaultVertex` | `bloxdDefaultVertex` |
| `bloxd_defaultSurface` | `bloxdDefaultSurface` |
| `bloxd_defaultLight` | `bloxdDefaultLight` |
| `bloxd_VertexIn` | `BloxdVertexIn` |
| `bloxd_Vertex` | `BloxdVertex` |
| `bloxd_SurfaceIn` | `BloxdSurfaceIn` |
| `bloxd_Surface` | `BloxdSurface` |
| `bloxd_LightIn` | `BloxdLightIn` |
| `bloxd_Light` | `BloxdLight` |
| `bloxd_packInputs` (internes Uniform) | `bloxdPackInputs` (`@group(3) @binding(0)`, 64 B) |

Die Hook-Arten (vertex / surface / light × Terrain / Flüssigkeit, 6 Stück) und das `pack.json`-Format (`apiVersion` / `name` / `author`) ändern sich nicht. Auch die Loader-Limits sind unverändert (Zip 32 MB / 1024 Einträge / 256 `.wgsl`-Dateien / 256 KB gesamt / Manifest 64 KB).

### 33. Wohin gelöschte Felder wandern

In v1 waren `time` / `eyePosition` / `sunDirection` / `originOffset` Struct-Felder. In v2 sind **diese Felder gelöscht und durch Header-Funktionen ersetzt**, die das Engine-Uniform (`bloxdPackInputs`) lesen. Da die Funktionen das Uniform direkt lesen, sind sie **auch aus Modul-Scope-Funktionen außerhalb von Hooks und aus Vertex-Hooks aufrufbar**.

| v1 | v2 |
|---|---|
| `s.time` / `v.time` / `l.time` | `bloxdTime()` |
| `s.sunDirection` / `l.sunDirection` | `bloxdSunDirection()` |
| `s.eyePosition` / `l.eyePosition` | `bloxdEyePosition()` |
| `s.originOffset` / `l.originOffset` | `bloxdOriginOffset()` |
| Weltkoordinatenbildung per `s.position + vec3f(...)` | `bloxdWorldPosition(s.position)` |
| `vec3i(floor(pos - normal*0.5)) + originOffset` | `bloxdFaceBlock(pos, normal)` |

### 34. Neuerung ①: `blockId` (blockeigenes Shading)

Alle 3 Structs `BloxdVertexIn` / `BloxdSurfaceIn` / `BloxdLightIn` erhalten `blockId: u32`. Die **ID des Blocks, dem die Fläche gehört** (0–65535), über die ganze Fläche konstant (per `@interpolate(flat)` übergeben). Dient zur texturfarben-unabhängigen Blockart-Erkennung. Die ID-Blockart-Tabelle liegt aber engine-intern und ist aus Paketen nicht referenzierbar: **Welche ID welcher Block ist, lässt sich in der Welt vermessen oder in der Referenz unten nachschlagen**. Intern wird die ID in das Alpha der Vertexfarbe (untere 8 Bit) und in das w der Normalen (obere 8 Bit) gebacken — 16 Bit insgesamt; daher rührt auch die 65535-Obergrenze. Das blockId-System selbst wird nur aktiv, solange ein aktives Shader-Pack existiert (ohne Pack behalten die Leitungen ihre Füllziele, aber innerhalb der Struct-Definitionen aus Teil II ist dieser Unterschied nicht beobachtbar).

**Referenz**: Der Autor veröffentlicht eine Liste der Spiel-Einträge unter [Bloxd-Entries-Data](https://github.com/imu31465/Bloxd-Entries-Data) (`entries.json`: Tabelle id ↔ Blockname; Rotations-/Meta-Varianten wie `Furnace|meta|rot2` stehen als eigene IDs drin). Zuordnungen können sich mit Spiel-Updates ändern — endgültige Werte im echten Spiel prüfen.

Häufige Blockarten (aus entries.json, Stand 2026-10-18; nur die Terrain-Familien mit den niedrigen IDs aufgelistet):

| ID | Blockname | ID | Blockname |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Air | 15 | Maple Wood Planks |
| 1 | Unloaded | 28 | Stone |
| 2 | Dirt | 29 | Messy Stone |
| 3 | Messy Dirt | 31 | Smooth Stone |
| 4 | Grass Block | 126 | Water |
| 5 | Sand | 128 | Bricks |
| 6 | Clay | 139 | Ice |
| 7 | Gravel | 147 | Bedrock |
| 8 | Snow | 149 | Cactus |

entries.json listet auch Nicht-Block-Einträge (Werkzeuge etc.), aber nur Block-Familien-IDs erreichen die Terrain-/Liquid-Hooks.

#### R-F. Blockart-Tönung per blockId

```wgsl
fn blockTint(blockId: u32) -> vec3f {
    // z. B.: Steinfamilie (High-Bit-Muster der ID) kalt tönen
    let stripe = f32((blockId >> 4u) & 1u);
    return mix(vec3f(1.0), vec3f(0.85, 0.95, 1.0), stripe * 0.5);
}

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var result = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    result.colour *= blockTint(surface.blockId);
    return result;
}
```

#### R-G. blockId in der Welt ausmessen — das Bit-Plane-Anzeige-Pack

Ein Debug-Rezept, um in der Welt die IDs von Blöcken auszumessen, die in der Tabelle fehlen. Durchlaufe die vordere Konstante `plane` mit `0, 1, 2, …`, während du die Farbe der Fläche des Blocks abliest, den du identifizieren willst.

```wgsl
const plane: u32 = 0u;

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    let d = (s.blockId >> (plane * 3u)) & 7u;
    var palette = array<vec3f, 8>(
        vec3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), vec3f(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), vec3f(0.0, 1.0, 0.0), vec3f(1.0, 1.0, 0.0),
        vec3f(0.0, 0.0, 1.0), vec3f(1.0, 0.0, 1.0), vec3f(0.0, 1.0, 1.0), vec3f(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));
    out.colour = palette[d];
    return out;
}
```

Die Fläche zeigt die 3 Bits von blockId direkt als RGB (schwarz = 0 / rot = 1 / grün = 2 / gelb = 3 / blau = 4 / magenta = 5 / cyan = 6 / weiß = 7). Eine Beobachtung liest eine Oktalziffer. Liest p0 → p3 nacheinander 3, 2, 7, 2, ist die von der oberen Ziffer gelesene Oktalzahl 2723 = 1491 die id (Lava). Terrain-Familien mit niedriger id kommen mit 2 Beobachtungen (p0, p1) aus. Verwendet nur den surface hook, läuft also auch in strict-Titeln.

#### R-H. Nur die Blätter schwanken lassen — Eingrenzung des Vertex-Hooks per blockId

Das R7-Wind-Rezept ([Teil III](../recipes/)) wellt das ganze Terrain, aber auch der Vertex-Hook kann `blockId` lesen — die Ziele lassen sich also auf Blattblöcke begrenzen. Die ID-Liste und das WGSL-Array (gemessen am 2026-10-18; 22 Sorten — Pine / Aspen / Maple / Jungle / Plum / Cedar / Palm / Autumn Maple / Fallen Maple / Pear / Cherry / Fallen Cherry / Spectral / Mango / Fruchtvarianten / Autumn Aspen):

```wgsl
const LEAF_IDS = array<u32, 22>(
    100u, 101u, 102u, 103u, 491u, 492u, 493u, 653u, 655u, 911u,
    1226u, 1227u, 1636u, 1969u, 2019u, 2020u, 2021u, 2022u, 2023u,
    2024u, 2025u, 2085u);

// vertex hooks werden in strict-Titeln automatisch deaktiviert (siehe §36)
#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT

fn sp_isLeaf(id: u32) -> bool {
    for (var i = 0u; i < 22u; i++) {
        if (LEAF_IDS[i] == id) { return true; }
    }
    return false;
}

fn bloxdTerrainVertex(v: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    var out = bloxdDefaultVertex(v);
    if (sp_isLeaf(v.blockId)) {
        let wp   = bloxdWorldPosition(v.position);
        let t    = bloxdTime();
        // Die Verschiebung ist eine glatte Funktion der Weltposition. Gemeinsam benutzte Vertices,
        // die auf denselben Weltpunkt zeigen, bewegen sich identisch, sodass Flächen nicht abreißen ([Teil III](../recipes/) R7 folgt demselben Prinzip)
        let sway = sin(wp.x * 0.9 + t * 1.7) * cos(wp.z * 0.7 + t * 1.1);
        out.position.x += sway * 0.045;
        out.position.z += sway * 0.030;
    }
    return out;
}

#endif
```

- Die ID-Liste wächst mit den Engine-Updates (allein bei der Messung kamen in einem neuen Build 50 Blocksorten hinzu). Um weiter zu nutzen, ergänze Neuheiten über [Bloxd-Entries-Data](https://github.com/imu31465/Bloxd-Entries-Data) oder durch Messen mit der Bit-Plane-Anzeige aus R-G und erweitere das Array
- `Fallen Maple Leaves` (655) / `Fallen Cherry Leaves` (1227) sind unsolide, auf den Boden gelegte Blattmatten. Wankt sie, scheint sie vom Boden abzuheben — eine Option ist, sie vom Array auszuschließen
- In strict-Titeln wird der Vertex-Hook pauschal deaktiviert, aber mit der obigen Guard schaltet das Pack einfach „auf Ruhe ab“ — die Fragment-seitigen Effekte bleiben aktiv

### 35. Neuerung ②: `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` und `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` (die wichtigste)

Der in v1 strukturell unmögliche Tiefenzugriff ist **nur für Liquid-Programme** freigegeben. Keine Farbe, aber **Geometrieinfo zu Distanz und Position der opaken Fläche dahinter**. Typische Nutzung: Absorptionsfarbe aus gemessener Wasserdicke berechnen.

Nutzungsregeln:

| Verwendung | Ergebnis |
|---|---|
| Guard-loser Aufruf in `bloxdLiquidSurface` / `bloxdLiquidLight` | OK (in Liquid-Varianten immer definiert) |
| Guard-loser Aufruf in `bloxdTerrainSurface` | FEHLER. Mit `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` umschließen |
| Aufruf in Vertex-Hooks | FEHLER (nur Surface-/Light-Hooks) |

Wer Tiefe auch in Terrain-Hooks nutzen will, umschließt mit `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` (Terrain-Hooks werden auch von Liquid-Programmen wiederverwendet, Tiefe gilt dort nur liquid-seitig).

#### R-E. Wasserdicken-Absorption (Beer-Lambert)

```wgsl
fn bloxdLiquidSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var result = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    let behind = bloxdOpaqueBehind();
    if (behind.found) {
        // Wassersäulenlänge = von aktueller Position bis zur opaken Fläche dahinter
        let thickness = distance(behind.position, surface.position);
        // Beer-Lambert-Absorption: Rot fällt schnell, Blau trägt weit
        let absorb = exp(-thickness * vec3f(0.35, 0.14, 0.08));
        result.colour *= absorb;
    } else {
        // dahinter Himmel = zu tiefem Wasserblau ziehen
        result.colour = mix(result.colour, vec3f(0.05, 0.15, 0.30), 0.4);
    }
    return result;
}
```

Anwendungen: dickenbasierte Absorption/Streuung, Wellen-/Kaustik-artige Musterprojektion aus Boden-Weltkoordinaten via `behind.position`, Himmelsreflexion an der Oberfläche mit Himmel-vs-Verdeckung-Unterscheidung per `found=false`, tiefengestaffelte Schaum- und Trübungsgrade. Schlägt der Aufbau der Tiefenkopie-Pipeline fehl, sichere Degradation zu „nichts dahinter". Die Verfügbarkeit der Tiefentextur wird bei der Erzeugung des Seiten-Renderers einmalig fixiert — maßgeblich ist „liest das aktive Paket Tiefe?". **Beim Einsatz eines Tiefe lesenden Pakets daher immer die Seite neu laden**. Wird Tiefe angefordert, während ein Paket aktiv ist, die Seite aber nicht neu geladen wurde, zeigt die Konsole einmalig eine `…reads scene depth on a page that didn't turn it on`-Warnung, und die Tiefentextur wird durch einen 1×1-Fallback ersetzt, sodass `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` immer `found = false` liefert.

### 36. Sonstige v2-Änderungen

- **Hook-Fallback**: Liquid-Programme fallen ohne definiertes `bloxdLiquidXxx` auf Terrain-Hooks zurück. **Pakete mit nur Terrain-Hooks wirken unverändert auch auf Wasser**. Falls unerwünscht, Liquid-seitige Hooks explizit definieren.
- **`BLOXD_LIGHTING`-Feld-Guards überflüssig**: `blockLight` etc. existieren in allen Varianten, in unlit mit Defaults (0 / 1 / Weiß / 0). `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` nur für Lichtabfragen nutzen. Bestehende Guards zu behalten ändert nichts.
- **`BLOXD_ALPHA`-Definitionsbedingung geändert**: In Nicht-Strict-Terrain-Varianten und allen Liquid-Varianten definiert, in strict × Terrain nicht. Beim Schreiben von alpha in Terrain-Hooks den Guard behalten.
- **Direkte Struct-Konstruktion verboten**: Konstruktoraufrufe wie `BloxdLight(...)` werden von der statischen Prüfung abgelehnt. Immer ab `bloxdDefault*` ändern oder die Eingabe kopieren.
- **`let _ =` wird `_ =`**: Die WGSL-Verwerfungszuweisung `_ = f();` ist gültig, aber `let _ = f();` wird abgelehnt.
- **offInStrict**: Eine Vertex-Hook-Definition oder ein aus Surface-/Light-Hooks erreichbares `discard` gibt keinen Fehler, sondern deaktiviert das ganze Paket in strikten Spielen automatisch (Einstellungs-UI zeigt `shaderPack:offInStrict`, in Allow-Spielen läuft es). Vertex-Hooks und `discard` mit `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` umschließen. Beachte: die Meldung der offiziellen Einstellungs-UI selbst weist an, den Rest mit `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` zu umschließen — ist keine bloße Konvention, sondern offizielle Empfehlung.
- **Fog-Erweiterung**: In der Fog-Berechnung sind 3 Modi LINEAR / EXP / EXP2 implementiert, aber die Spiel-Einstellung bleibt wie bisher immer LINEAR, also gilt die bestehende Fog-Spec weiter. Auch die Bedeutung von `fogColour` ist offiziell festgeschrieben (nur in völlig fog-freien Szenen schwarz).
- **Unverändert**: Lift-Kurve, 35-%-Kanal-Floor, heldLight-Dämpfung (`pow(lightDist, 0.75)`) und Ambient-Boost, Sonnen-/Mondrichtungs-Spec, Standard-Fog-Farbe, Time-Wrap (3600 s), Richtlichter (max 4), nur Lite (WebGPU), Speichermechanismus (IndexedDB), reserviertes Wort `mod`.

### 37. v1 → v2-Migrationscheckliste

1. **pack.json**: `"apiVersion": 1` → `"apiVersion": 2`
2. **Bezeichner**: alles per §32-Tabelle ersetzen (Hook-Namen, Struct-Namen, Default-Funktionen)
3. **Gelöschte Felder portieren**: per §33-Tabelle zu Header-Funktionen (`s.time` → `bloxdTime()` etc.)
4. **`fogFactor` → `fogVisibility`** umbenennen
5. **Direkte Struct-Konstruktionen entfernen**
6. **`let _ =` zu `_ =`** korrigieren
7. **Vertex-Hooks und discard mit `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` umschließen**
8. Prüfen, dass **Wasser auch Terrain-Hook-Effekte abbekommt**; falls unerwünscht, Liquid-Hooks explizit definieren
9. (Optional) Fog ab `litColour` selbst verwalten / Wasserdicken-Absorption per `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` addieren / blockeigene Looks per `blockId`
10. **Auch Stufe 2 (Browser-Tint) prüfen** — besonders Klammern bei Ausdrücken mit `^` `&` `|` `<<` `>>`. Code kann die statische Prüfung bestehen und trotzdem vom Browser abgelehnt werden (§38)

### 38. Zweite Prüfstufe — der Browser-WGSL-Compiler ist strenger als der eingebaute Parser

Die Spiel-Paketprüfung läuft in **2 Stufen**. Stufe 1 ist die statische Prüfung (engine-eingebauter JS-Parser — Hook-Signaturen, verbotene Syntax, paketeigene Regeln wie die sceneDepth-Nutzung), und Stufe 2 ist die Browser-Prüfung (die dem Kompilierungsergebnis beigelegten Stubs werden mit der echten WebGPU-Implementierung kompiliert, und Fehler werden auf die Ursprungsdateizeilen des Pakets zurückgemappt angezeigt. Das „Saved, but it won't run until you fix these errors" der UI ist diese Stufe). Suffixe wie `(only in terrain)` am Ende der Fehleranzeige bezeichnen „die program-Art der Variante, in der der Fehler auftrat".

Der eingebaute Parser implementiert die WGSL-Operator-Bindungs-(Binding-)Regeln nicht, und **Code kann die statische Prüfung bestehen und trotzdem vom Browser abgelehnt werden**. Häufig betroffen ist das Standardmuster des Integer-Hashings:

| Operator | Folge |
|---|---|
| `<<` `>>` | Nur bis Unary-Level direkt kombinierbar. `a + b << c` ist ein Fehler |
| `&` `^` `\|` | Nur bis Unary-Level direkt kombinierbar. `a * b ^ c` ist ein Fehler |
| `&&` `\|\|` | Vermischung verboten. `a && b \|\| c` ist ein Fehler |

#### Klammerung (NG / OK)

```wgsl
// NG — besteht die statische Prüfung, wird aber vom Browser (Tint) abgelehnt:
//     mixing '*' and '^' requires parenthesis
let h = a * 73856093u ^ b * 19349663u ^ c * 83492791u;

// OK — jede Multiplikation klammern (Kette desselben Operators A ^ B ^ C ist linksassoziativ legal)
let h = (a * 73856093u) ^ (b * 19349663u) ^ (c * 83492791u);
```

Kein abgedruckter Code in diesem Leitfaden enthält dieses Muster (die `+`/`*`-Mischungen von `pack_hash3` und `h ^ (h >> 16u)` sind bereits geklammert, also spec-konform). Nach dem Schreiben eines Pakets sowohl Stufe 1 als auch Stufe 2 durchlaufen.

### 39. Über unabhängig ähnliche Materialien

Es existiert ein Community-Material mit fast gleichem Inhalt: [Shader von GlitchHunterCoder/Bloxd-Essay](https://github.com/GlitchHunterCoder/Bloxd-Essay/tree/main/Shader). Vor diesem Leitfaden publiziert, aber **dieser Leitfadeninhalt stammt aus glms eigener Analyse der echten Bloxd-Bundle-Dateien (Webpack-Chunk-Satz) — kein Copy-Paste**. Beide stimmen überein, weil unabhängiges Untersuchen derselben Implementierung zu denselben Schlüssen führt.

## Teil IX: Migrationsleitfaden für API Version 3

> **Seit 2026-10-26 ersetzt: die aktuelle API ist Version 5** — v3-Pakete werden beim Laden genau so abgelehnt, wie es hier für v2 beschrieben ist. Diesen Teil *und danach* [Teil X](../history/v4.md) anwenden (v3 → v4: Textur-API, `fogAlpha`-Umbenennung, `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition`, `hit`). Danach auch [Teil XII](../history/v5.md) anwenden (v4 → v5).

Ziel-Build: `3ymzdd.main.fae4743f.js` — **der seit 2026-10-19 live ausgelieferte Produktions-Build**. Das Bundle, das bloxd.io in Produktion ausliefert, ist byte-identisch (per md5 geprüft, Haupt-Bundle und Shader-Pack-Chunks gleichermaßen) mit dem Preprod-Deploy, gegen das dieser Teil ursprünglich untersucht wurde; alles hier gilt also unverändert für die Produktion. Das Paketmodell behält seine v2-Form (gleiche `pack.json`-Felder, gleiche Loader-Limits, gleiches Uniform-Layout).

Die Teile I–VII dieser Anleitung sind weiterhin auf v2-Basis geschrieben. Dieser Teil sammelt in derselben Reihenfolge wie [Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) die Migrationspunkte v2 → v3 und die Neuerungen von v3. Die Umstellung ist größtenteils mechanisch (§47), aber nur eine Änderung verändert tatsächlich das Verhalten — das Standardlicht dämpft Emission jetzt durch Fog (§43) — und `blockId` wird vollständig durch `blockFlags` ersetzt (§42); vor der Verteilung daher immer per In-Game-Kompilierung prüfen.

Neu in dieser Revision: Die Abschnitte **§49–§54** gehen über die Migration hinaus in Engine-Interna, die aus dem Produktions-Build restauriert wurden — wie der Lite-Renderer deine Hooks tatsächlich aufruft, die echte Fog-Funktion mit vier Modi, die exakte Implementierung von `bloxdOpaqueBehind()`, den vollständigen blockFlags-Übertragungsweg von der Blockregistrierung bis zu deinem Hook und die Validierungspipeline mit ihrem gemessenen Header-Hash. Das sind die detailliertesten bislang öffentlich dokumentierten Fakten über das Paketsystem, und sie beantworten mehrere Fragen, die andere Anleitungen noch als offen führen.

### 40. Das Schicksal von v2-Paketen (erst das Fazit)

**Update 2026-10-19: v3 hat Preprod verlassen und ist jetzt das, was die Live-Seite ausliefert.** Jedes vor dem Rollout gespeicherte v2-Paket — einschließlich jedes als v2 verteilten Pakets — scheitert in Produktion genau wie unten beschrieben; die Migration aus §47 ist für alle, die heute Pakete verteilen, nicht mehr optional.

Der Build verlangt, dass die Manifest-`apiVersion` **exakt 3 entspricht**, und es gibt **keinen parallelen v2/v3-Support**. Ein v2-Paket wird beim Laden mit den Meldungen zur falschen API-Version abgelehnt (i18n-Keys, Platzhaltertext):

> `loadWrongApiVersion`: "This pack is for shader pack API version {{packVersion}}. Bloxd supports version {{version}}."
>
> `statusWrongApiVersion`: "This shader pack is for API version {{packVersion}}, so it won't run. Load a version {{version}} pack to replace it."
>

Gespeicherte Pakete behalten den v2-Lebenszyklus ([Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) §31): Jeder Build hasht seinen Engine-Header, Engine-Updates markieren gespeicherte Pakete automatisch als „muss erneut geprüft werden“, und ein gespeichertes Paket, dessen `apiVersion` eine andere als die aktuelle ist, wird als nicht ausführbar markiert (mit der obigen Statusmeldung, die auf den Ersatz verweist), statt einen Fehler auszulösen.

### 41. pack.json und der Uniform-Buffer (was unverändert bleibt)

- Die Pflichtfelder im Manifest sind unverändert: `{ apiVersion, name, author }`.
- Die Loader-Limits sind unverändert: 32 MB Zip / 1024 Einträge / 256 `.wgsl`-Dateien / 256 KB Code gesamt / 64 KB Manifest.
- Das Uniform der Engine ist in seiner Form unverändert: `@group(3) @binding(0)`, 64 B, mit — in Deklarationsreihenfolge — Zeit, Render-Offset, Sonnenrichtung und Augenposition. Das Layout ist mit `minBindingSize: 64` registriert, und die exakte Feldanordnung ist `seconds: f32` @ Byte 0, `renderOffset: vec3i` @ 16, `sunDirection: vec3f` @ 32, `eyePosition: vec3f` @ 48. Zwei interne Feldnamen haben sich geändert: `time` → `seconds`, `originOffset` → `renderOffset`. Die **Byte-Anordnung ist identisch mit v2**, und für Paketcode ändert sich ohnehin nichts, weil Pakete das Uniform nicht direkt benennen dürfen (der Engine-Header markiert es als engine-provided und read-only, „which packs can't name“); weiter über die Header-Funktionen `bloxdSeconds()` / `bloxdRenderOffset()` gehen.
- In Gruppe 3 des Pakets ist jetzt ein zweiter Platz dokumentiert: `@group(3) @binding(1)` ist die Szenentiefe-Textur, die `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` liest (vollständige Implementierung in §51). Das 64-Byte-Uniform bleibt bei Binding 0; Pakete können weiterhin keines der beiden Bindings benennen.

### 42. blockId wird blockFlags: Materialien pro Block als Bitflags (die Hauptänderung)

In allen drei Hook-Eingabestrukturen (`BloxdVertexIn` / `BloxdSurfaceIn` / `BloxdLightIn`) wird das v2-Feld `blockId: u32` **ersetzt** durch `blockFlags: u32`. Engine-Text zum Feld: *"What kind of block this face is: `bloxdBlockFlag*` bits, the same across the face."* Die Engine liefert jetzt die Materialdaten selbst, daher ist der v2-Weg, Materialien aus numerischen ID-Bereichen zu raten oder ID-Tabellen in der Welt zu pflegen ([Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) §34), nicht mehr nötig.

Die Bits sind als benannte Konstanten exponiert:

```wgsl
// Einen Test mit (blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagRock) != 0 ausführen.
const bloxdBlockFlagOpaque: u32 = 1;
const bloxdBlockFlagEmissive: u32 = 2;
const bloxdBlockFlagVegetation: u32 = 4;
const bloxdBlockFlagDirt: u32 = 8;
const bloxdBlockFlagSand: u32 = 16;
const bloxdBlockFlagRock: u32 = 32;
```

| Wert | Konstante | Bedeutung (Engine-Hinweise, verdichtet) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `bloxdBlockFlagOpaque` | Vollständig opak — Blätter und Eis eingeschlossen. Nicht Glas, Wasser, Lava, Spawner oder Geister- und unsichtbare Blöcke. |
| 2 | `bloxdBlockFlagEmissive` | Gibt Blocklicht ab, wie Neon, Portale, Lampen, Lava und Beacon. Leuchtende Erze zählen, egal wie schwach. |
| 4 | `bloxdBlockFlagVegetation` | Blätter und das Gras auf Grasblöcken (Grasblöcke tragen auch Dirt). Keine Kakteen, Pilzblöcke oder Heu. |
| 8 | `bloxdBlockFlagDirt` | Dirt und Erde, Grasblöcke eingeschlossen. Rocky Dirt ist ebenfalls Gestein. |
| 16 | `bloxdBlockFlagSand` | Sand, Red Sand und jeder Sandstein — der auch Gestein ist. |
| 32 | `bloxdBlockFlagRock` | Stein und seine Varianten, Andesit, Diorit, Granit, Kies, Erze, Sandstein, Rocky Dirt, Bedrock, Obsidian und Magma. |

Ein Block aus mehreren Materialien trägt **jedes** passende Flag (das Engine-Beispiel selbst: Sandstein ist Sand und Gestein, bekommt also beide). Blätter sind Vegetation, aber kein Dirt; Grasblöcke sind gleichzeitig Vegetation und Dirt.

Die Flags vegetation / dirt / sand / rock werden anhand des registrierten **Anzeigenamens** des Blocks vergeben (opaque / emissive stammen stattdessen aus den Opazitäts- und Emissionsdaten der Engine): Namen, die auf `Leaves` enden, sowie `Grass Block` sind Vegetation; Namen wie `Dirt` / `Soil` (und jeder `Grass Block`) sind Dirt; genau `Sand` und `Red Sand` sowie jeder Name, der `Sandstone` enthält, sind Sand; Namen mit `Stone` / `Andesite` / `Diorite` / `Granite`, jedes `Ore`, außerdem Yellowstone, Gravel, Bedrock, Obsidian, Magma, Rocky Dirt (und Sandstein) sind Gestein.

#### Die exakten Namensregeln (die Flags jedes Blocks selbst ableiten)

Die vier Material-Bits stammen aus einem festen Klassifikator über den registrierten Anzeigenamen des Blocks. Varianten-Namen (alles nach `|`) werden zuerst entfernt, sodass Varianten die Flags des Basisblocks erben. Dann gilt:

| Bit | Regel (auf dem bereinigten Namen ausgewertet) |
|---|---|
| vegetation | der Name **endet auf** ` Leaves` oder **endet auf** ` Grass Block` |
| dirt | der Name **ist exakt** `Dirt`, **endet auf** ` Dirt` oder ` Soil`, oder **endet auf** ` Grass Block` |
| sand | der Name **ist exakt** `Sand` oder `Red Sand`, oder **enthält** `Sandstone` |
| rock | der Name **ist exakt** einer von `Yellowstone` / `Gravel` / `Bedrock` / `Obsidian` / `Magma` / `Rocky Dirt`, **enthält** `Sandstone`, **endet auf** ` Ore`, oder enthält `Stone` / `Andesite` / `Diorite` / `Granite` als eigenständiges Wort |

Yellowstone ist ausdrücklich aufgeführt, weil `Stone` in `Yellowstone` kein eigenständiges Wort ist. Opaque und Emissive kommen **nicht** aus dem Namen — sie stammen aus den Opazitäts- und Blocklicht-Emissionsdaten der Engine, lassen sich mit diesen Regeln also nicht ableiten.

Quelle: der Namensklassifikator der Engine (Modul 28537, Bundle `3ymzdd`); gegen alle 7.861 benannten Blöcke verifiziert, 2026-10-20.

Beispiel — Tönung pro Block nach Material:

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if ((surface.blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagVegetation) != 0) {
        out.colour *= vec3f(0.92, 1.10, 0.86);
    }
    return out;
}
```

Wirkung auf v2-Rezepte: Das 22 Einträge umfassende Blatt-ID-Array von R-H ([Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) §34) schrumpft auf `(blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagVegetation) != 0`. Die Referenz zwischen Block-IDs und Blocknamen bei [Bloxd-Entries-Data](https://github.com/imu31465/Bloxd-Entries-Data) bleibt für Nicht-Shader-Zwecke nützlich, muss für Material-Styling aber nicht mehr in der Welt nachgeschlagen werden.

#### Blätter ohne das Gras (die Frage, die alle stellen)

`vegetation` allein trifft Blätter **und** das Gras auf Grasblöcken, die auch
`dirt` tragen. Dirt ausschließen, um nur Blätter zu bewegen — der Diskriminator,
den die Feldnotizen der Engine selbst ausbuchstabieren:

```wgsl
// Nur Blätter: Vegetation ohne Dirt. Grasblöcke sind Vegetation UND Dirt.
let isLeaf = (blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagVegetation) != 0u
           && (blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagDirt) == 0u;

// Nur Grasblöcke (die grasbewachsenen Flächen der Terrain-Oberfläche):
let isGrassBlock = (blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagVegetation) != 0u
                 && (blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagDirt) != 0u;
```

Gegen die Live-Registry verifiziert (2026-10-20, Bundle `3ymzdd`):
`vegetation && !dirt` trifft exakt die 45 Blattregistrierungen (22 Basistypen —
dieselben 22, die das v2-R-H-ID-Array gemessen hat); `vegetation && dirt` trifft exakt
die 8 Grasblöcke. Keine Ausnahmen in beide Richtungen — Registry-Zahlen zum Stand jenes Builds; neue Blöcke erhöhen die Zahlen, ohne die Regel zu ändern. Mit `vertex.normal`
(oben/unten) kombinieren, um Flächen auszuwählen, z. B. nur Grasblock-Oberseiten.

### 43. Funktionsumbenennungen und semantische Änderungen

| v2 | v3 | Hinweise |
|---|---|---|
| `bloxdTime()` | `bloxdSeconds()` | Sekunden seit dem Laden der Seite (Hinweis zur f32-Präzision unten) |
| `bloxdOriginOffset()` | `bloxdRenderOffset()` | Dieselbe Größe: Renderposition + dies = Weltposition |
| `const bloxdTimeWrap: f32 = 3600` | **entfernt** | Zeiträume selbst auf der Paketseite definieren |
| `engineColour` (in `BloxdLightIn`) | **entfernt** (14 → 13 Felder) | Aus `litColour` + Fog neu aufbauen |
| Hook-Parameter `v` / `s` / `l` | `vertex` / `surface` / `light` | Schreibweise im Template; Signaturen unverändert |

- **`bloxdSeconds()`** — Sekunden seit dem Laden der Seite. In f32 zählt es in Schritten von unter 1 ms für die ersten 4,5 Stunden und von etwa 4 ms zwischen 9 und 18 Stunden. Der Header empfiehlt das Idiom `bloxdSeconds() % period`, das von 0 bis `period` zählt und dann neu beginnt — ein sauberer Ersatz für die entfernte Wrap-Konstante.
- **`bloxdRenderOffset()`** — ganze Blöcke: „a render position plus this is a world position.“ Es ändert sich, während der Spieler reist, daher bleiben Renderpositionen nahe am Spieler — und damit präzise. In der gesamten Anleitung heißt die Größe, die der v2-Text noa-lokaler Offset nannte, jetzt einheitlich **Renderposition** / Render-Offset; es ist dieselbe Größe, die `bloxdOriginOffset()` zurückgab.
- **`bloxdTimeWrap` entfernt** — ein Paket, das die Zeit bei 3600 s umbrechen ließ, deklariert jetzt seine eigene Konstante, z. B. `const timeWrap: f32 = 3600.0;` und `% timeWrap`.
- **Semantik des Standardlichts** — der v2-Standard war `engineColour + emission × fogVisibility`; der v3-Standard setzt es als `bloxdApplyFog(litColour + emission, light)` zusammen — **Emission wird jetzt innerhalb des Standards durch Fog gedämpft**, sodass die kombinierte Ausgabe gemeinsam durch den Fog-Blend geht. Portierungstabelle:

  | v2-Ausdruck | v3-Portierung |
  |---|---|
  | `l.engineColour` | `bloxdApplyFog(l.litColour, l)` |
  | `l.engineColour + s.emission * l.fogVisibility` | `bloxdApplyFog(l.litColour + s.emission, l)` |

  ```wgsl
  // v3-Portierung des v2-Lesezugriffs `l.engineColour + s.emission * l.fogVisibility`:
  out.colour = bloxdApplyFog(light.litColour + surface.emission, light);
  ```
- **In Name und Bedeutung unverändert**: `bloxdEyePosition()`, `bloxdSunDirection()`, `bloxdFaceBlock()`, `bloxdApplyFog()`, `bloxdWorldPosition()`.

### 44. Neue Header-Konstanten: `bloxdPi` und `bloxdTau`

```wgsl
// Eine halbe Umdrehung und eine volle Umdrehung, in Radiant.
const bloxdPi: f32 = 3.1415926535898;
const bloxdTau: f32 = 6.2831853071796;
```

Nützlich sowohl für trigonometrische Tricks als auch weil Pakete π nicht mehr hartcodieren müssen. Auf Namenskollisionen achten: Eine paketlokale Konstante gleichen Namens kollidiert jetzt mit der Prüfung des Headers auf doppelte Bezeichner — jede Neudeklaration von `bloxdPi` / `bloxdTau` im eigenen Code entfernen oder umbenennen.

### 45. Das Sechs-Hook-Template (Flüssigkeits-Hooks offiziell gezeigt)

Der mit dem Build veröffentlichte Standard-Pakettext enthält jetzt **alle sechs Hooks** — Terrain / Flüssigkeit × Vertex / Surface / Light —, jeder gibt seinen Engine-Standard zurück. Die Engine-Kommentare führen es so ein: *"Every hook returns its engine default. Copy a hook and change its output to start a shader pack."*

```wgsl
// Jeder Hook gibt seinen Engine-Standard zurück. Kopiere einen Hook und ändere
// seine Ausgabe, um ein Shader-Paket zu beginnen.

// Strict-Spiele lassen Terrain, wo es ist: Ohne Guard würde dieser Hook
// das ganze Shader-Paket dort abschalten.
#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT
fn bloxdTerrainVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    return bloxdDefaultVertex(vertex);
}
#endif

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
}

fn bloxdTerrainLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
}

// Wasser nutzt diese. Wenn gelöscht, nutzt Wasser stattdessen deine Terrain-Hooks.
#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT
fn bloxdLiquidVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    return bloxdDefaultVertex(vertex);
}
#endif

fn bloxdLiquidSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
}

fn bloxdLiquidLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
}
```

- Die Kommentare der Hooks nennen die Flüssigkeitsregeln direkt: **Wasser braucht das Trio; löschst du es, verwendet Wasser wieder deine Terrain-Hooks** (das aus v2 bekannte Fallback-Verhalten, [Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) §36, jetzt im Template selbst festgeschrieben).
- `bloxdLiquidVertex` liegt im selben `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT`-Guard wie `bloxdTerrainVertex` — ohne Guard würde es das ganze Paket in Strict-Spielen abschalten, genau wie Vertex-Effekte auf der Terrain-Seite.
- Die Template-Schreibweisen sind jetzt die vollen Parameternamen `vertex` / `surface` / `light` (das v2-Template nutzte die kurzen `v` / `s` / `l`). Die Parameternamen im eigenen Code sind frei — nur die Signaturen zählen.

### 46. Variantenmatrix: die Programm-Achse und Makro-Änderungen

Varianten werden über eine Matrix aus **strict × lighting × program** erzeugt — dieselben 8 Kombinationen wie in v2, aber Terrain / Flüssigkeit ist jetzt eine explizite Achse der Matrix. Die Variantennamen schreiben das als `allow|strict · unlit|lit · terrain|liquid` aus und erscheinen in der UI als ``terrain`` / `liquid`, `strict` / `non-strict`, `lighting on` / `lighting off` (Fehleranzeigen können „(only in {{variants}})“ anhängen).

| Makro | Definiert in |
|---|---|
| `BLOXD_STRICT` | Strict-Varianten (beide Programme) |
| `BLOXD_LIGHTING` | Varianten mit Lighting an (beide Programme) |
| `BLOXD_ALPHA` | **alle Flüssigkeitsvarianten** plus Nicht-Strict-**Terrain**-Varianten |
| `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` | **alle Flüssigkeitsvarianten** |

Zwei Dinge ändern sich für Autoren gegenüber den v2-Regeln ([Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) §36):

- **`BLOXD_ALPHA` ist gegenüber v2 unverändert.** Der Variantengenerator enthält die Literalzeile `"liquid"!==program&&strict||push("BLOXD_ALPHA")` — die JS-Operatorpriorität macht *(Terrain **und** strict)* zum einzigen Fall, der den push überspringt, sodass das Makro in **jeder Flüssigkeitsvariante (strict oder nicht strict) und in Nicht-Strict-Terrain** definiert ist; nur Strict-Terrain lässt es weg. Flüssigkeitsseitiger `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA`-Code wird genau wie immer hineinkompiliert, und das Alpha-Zurückschreiben aus §49 (eingefügt für Flüssigkeitsprogramme oder Nicht-Strict-Varianten) deckt sich exakt mit dieser Menge.
- **`BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` ist in Flüssigkeitsvarianten immer definiert**, daher bleibt die Tiefennutzung dort ohne Guard in Ordnung, genau wie in v2 (§35); in Terrain-Hooks braucht sie weiterhin den `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH`-Wrap.

### 47. v2 → v3-Migrationscheckliste

1. **pack.json**: `"apiVersion": 2` → `"apiVersion": 3`
2. **`blockId` → `blockFlags`** in allen drei Eingabestrukturen; Material-Styling als Bittests gegen `bloxdBlockFlag*`-Konstanten ausdrücken (§42); ID-Bereichs-Heuristiken aus v2 entfernen
3. **`bloxdTime()` → `bloxdSeconds()`**; eigenen Zeitraum statt des entfernten `bloxdTimeWrap` deklarieren (`% period`)
4. **`bloxdOriginOffset()` → `bloxdRenderOffset()`**
5. **Lichtmathematik von `engineColour` auf `litColour` + Fog umbauen** gemäß der Tabelle in §43; beachten, dass der Standard Emission jetzt durch Fog dämpft
6. **Flüssigkeits-Hooks**: `bloxdLiquid*` explizit definieren, wenn Wasser anders behandelt werden soll; weglassen, um auf die Terrain-Hooks zurückzufallen
7. **Keine `BLOXD_ALPHA`-Prüfung nötig** — die Variantenmenge ist gegenüber v2 unverändert: alle Flüssigkeitsvarianten plus Nicht-Strict-Terrain definieren es, nur Strict-Terrain lässt es weg (§46)
8. **`bloxdPi` / `bloxdTau` verwenden**, wo trigonometrienahe Konstanten hartcodiert waren; paketlokale Neudeklarationen entfernen, die jetzt den Header duplizieren
9. **Strict-Guards behalten**: Vertex-Hooks und `discard` bleiben in `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` gewrappt; das Template schützt `bloxdLiquidVertex` genauso wie Terrain
10. **Im Spiel validieren** — das Paket in einem Spiel kompilieren und testen, das Shader-Pakete unterstützt

### 48. Weitere v3-Änderungen und Hinweise

- **Die Validierung bleibt zweistufig** ([Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) §38): zuerst statische Validierung, dann die echte WebGPU-Kompilierung des Browsers über generierte Stub-Schnipsel, die deine Hooks aufrufen, mit Fehlern, die auf Quelldateien / -zeilen zurückgeführt werden, und Diagnosen, die die ursprünglichen Namen engine-seitiger Bezeichner über ein Mapping wiederherstellen.
- **Strict-Diagnosen nennen den Grund**: Ein Vertex-Hook, der Terrain verschiebt, meldet „… moves terrain, which strict games prevent.“, und `discard` in Surface-/Light-Hooks meldet „discard makes terrain see-through, which strict games prevent.“; die Einstellungsoberfläche behält den Hinweis „wrap each one listed below in `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT ... #endif`.“ (`offInStrict`).
- **Loader-Meldungen**: Fehlerarten und Limits sind unverändert; "Zip64 archives aren't supported." wird als UI-Meldung angezeigt (`loadZip64`). Das Inventar der Paket-UI-Strings umfasst 57 `shaderPack:*`-Keys; unter den Ladephase-Fehlern vervollständigen `loadNoWgsl` (ein Zip mit null `.wgsl`-Dateien) und `loadNotZip` (eine Datei ohne Zip-End-of-Archive-Signatur) die Menge.
- **Mit der Paket-UI wird kein WGSL-Editor im Spiel ausgeliefert.** Der Einstellungsbildschirm bietet keinen Shader-Code-Editor — Pakete werden außerhalb des Spiels als Zip-Dateien erstellt. (Ein CodeMirror-Editor existiert zwar im Bundle, ist aber der JavaScript-Editor der Custom-Game-Scripting-UI; er hat keine WGSL-Unterstützung und keine Verbindung zum Paketsystem.)
- **Hardware-Gate**: Lite benötigt einen Treiber, der das WebGPU-Feature `shader-f16` unterstützt; zu alte Treiber werden mit einer Meldung wie "Intel driver too old for Lite (no shader-f16)" abgelehnt.
- **Lichtänderungen validieren gespeicherte Pakete neu**: Wenn die Lighting-Einstellung zur Laufzeit geändert wird, führt die Engine die Paketprüfung erneut aus (`changed → recheck`); die Replay-Ansicht ruft denselben Hook mit `changed: false` auf und überspringt die erneute Prüfung.
- **Formulierung**: Text über Spiele, die Shader-Pakete akzeptieren, lautet jetzt „in games that **support** them“.
- **Geltungsbereich der Titel**: Die Menge der Spiele, in denen Pakete laufen, ist gegenüber dem vorherigen Build unverändert.

### 49. Engine-Interna: wie der Lite-Renderer deine Hooks aufruft

Alles in §40–§48 ist das, was Loader und Header dir sagen. Dieser Abschnitt und die folgenden dokumentieren, was die Engine zur Laufzeit tatsächlich tut, restauriert aus dem Produktions-Bundle (dem Lite-Renderer — ein 175-KB-Chunk; der echte Name der Integrationsquelldatei `lite/terrainShaderPack.ts` überlebt in ihren Fehlermeldungen). Nichts davon ändert, was du schreibst, aber es beseitigt das Rätselraten darüber, was deine Hooks erhalten — und beantwortet mehrere Fragen, die andere Community-Anleitungen noch als offen führen.

Der Renderer „ruft“ deine Hooks nicht aus JavaScript auf. Wenn ein Paket die Validierung besteht, **fügt die Engine deine Hook-Aufrufe in ihr eigenes Terrain-WGSL ein**, indem sie feste Ankerzeilen im Shader-Text ersetzt. Ein Anker muss genau einmal passen — null oder mehrere Treffer brechen ab mit `at the shader pack ${hook} hook: ${no|more than one} anchor (lite/terrainShaderPack.ts)`.

| Stufe | Ankerzeile im Engine-Shader | Was eingefügt wird |
|---|---|---|
| vertex | ein vierzeiliger Block von `let worldPos = vec4f(vertexInputs.position + chunk.xyz, 1.0);` bis `vertexOutputs.vNormalW = normalize(vertexInputs.normal.xyz);` | `BloxdVertexIn` bauen, deinen Vertex-Hook aufrufen, `worldPos` zurückschreiben — das Einfügen schreibt außerdem `let worldPos` in `var worldPos` um |
| surface | `baseColor = vec4f(baseColor.rgb * fragmentInputs.vColor, baseColor.a);` | `BloxdSurfaceIn` bauen, deinen Surface-Hook aufrufen, `baseColor` / `alpha` zurückschreiben |
| lit colour | kurz vor `color = vec4f(mix(uniforms.vFogColor, color.rgb, fog), …)` | `let bloxdSpLitColour = color.rgb;` — fängt die Farbe vor dem Fog ein |
| light | der abschließende `return color;` des Fragment-Shaders | `BloxdLightIn` bauen, deinen Light-Hook aufrufen, `color` zurückschreiben — nach dem Fog-Mix |

Der eingefügte Code, restauriert aus dem ausgelieferten Bundle (Ausdrücke für Lichtlevel-Proben gekürzt, wo die Engine-Formatierung lang läuft):

```wgsl
// Vertex-Stufe — Nicht-Strict-Varianten mit Vertex-Hook
{
    let bloxdSpVertexIn = BloxdVertexIn(worldPos.xyz, vertexOutputs.vNormalW,
                                        vertexOutputs.vBlockFlags);
    let bloxdSpVertex = /* dein bloxdTerrainVertex / bloxdLiquidVertex */(bloxdSpVertexIn);
    worldPos = vec4f(bloxdSpVertex.position, worldPos.w);
}
```

```wgsl
// Fragment-Stufe — Surface
let bloxdSpSurfaceIn = BloxdSurfaceIn(baseColor.rgb, alpha,
        normalize(fragmentInputs.vNormalW), fragmentInputs.vPositionW,
        fragmentInputs.vBlockFlags);
let bloxdSpSurface = /* dein Surface-Hook */(bloxdSpSurfaceIn);
baseColor = vec4f(bloxdSpSurface.colour, baseColor.a);
alpha = bloxdSpSurface.alpha;   // nur eingefügt, wenn das Programm Flüssigkeit oder die Variante nicht strict ist
```

```wgsl
// Fragment-Stufe — Light
{
    let bloxdSpLightIn = BloxdLightIn(
        bloxdSpLitColour,                        // litColour
        fragmentInputs.vTerrainLambert,          // directional
        ambient,                                 // ambient
        /* Lichtlevel-Varying */.rgb,            // blockLight
        /* Himmelskanal desselben Varyings */,   // skyLight
        uniforms.uAmbientLightColour,            // ambientLightColour
        uniforms.uSkyLightColour,                // skyLightColour
        /* Term des gehaltenen Lichts (siehe unten) */, // heldLight
        select(vec3f(0.0), uniforms.vFogColor,
               uniforms.vFogInfos.x != 0.0),     // fogColour — nur ohne jeglichen Fog schwarz
        fog,                                     // fogVisibility
        fragmentInputs.vPositionW,               // position
        normalize(fragmentInputs.vNormalW),      // normal
        fragmentInputs.vBlockFlags);             // blockFlags
    let bloxdSpLight = /* dein Light-Hook */(bloxdSpSurface, bloxdSpLightIn);
    color = vec4f(bloxdSpLight.colour, color.a);
}
```

Vier Fakten zur Durchsetzung ergeben sich direkt aus diesem Einfügen:

- **Strict-Terrain ignoriert Alpha-Änderungen des Surface-Hooks.** Das Zurückschreiben von `alpha = bloxdSpSurface.alpha` wird nur für Flüssigkeitsprogramme oder Nicht-Strict-Varianten eingefügt — die Implementierung hinter der Makrotabelle aus §46. (In Strict-Terrain wird dein `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA`-Code ohnehin nicht hineinkompiliert; jetzt ist außerdem bestätigt, dass ungeschützte Alpha-Schreibzugriffe dort verworfen werden.)
- **Eine Strict-Variante, die trotzdem einen Vertex-Hook deklariert, führt ihn nie aus** — die Engine meldet das zur Build-Zeit: `Shader pack code ${variant} is strict and has a vertex hook, which strict mode never runs`. Deshalb umschließt das offizielle Template (§45) `bloxdLiquidVertex` mit demselben `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT` wie sein Terrain-Gegenstück.
- Die `bloxdSp*`-Bezeichner — **14 insgesamt**: `bloxdSpVertexIn`, `bloxdSpVertex`, `bloxdSpSurfaceIn`, `bloxdSpSurface`, `bloxdSpLightIn`, `bloxdSpLight`, `bloxdSpLitColour`, `bloxdSpSceneDepth`, `bloxdSpPixel`, `bloxdSpPositionW`, `bloxdSpZ`, `bloxdSpEye`, `bloxdSpScale`, `bloxdSpBehind` — sind engine-seitige Temporaries. Dein Code sieht sie nie, aber sie tauchen in Diagnosen und in jeder Reverse-Engineering-Ausgabe auf, daher lohnt es sich, sie auf Anhieb zu erkennen.
- **Die Abkürzung für die Standard-Surface.** Wenn der Surface-Hook einer Variante buchstäblich `bloxdDefaultSurface` ist, überspringt die Engine das Einfügen der Zurückschreibzeilen für `baseColor` / `alpha` vollständig — der Standard erzeugt diese Werte bereits, die Zuweisung wäre also toter Code. Unveränderte Hook-Ketten kosten nichts.

**Was `BloxdLightIn` tatsächlich speist** — Feld für Feld, aus dem eingefügten Code:

| Feld | Engine-seitige Quelle |
|---|---|
| `litColour` | die Fragmentfarbe, die kurz vor dem Fog-Mix eingefangen wird (der Anker `bloxdSpLitColour`) — „before emission and fog“, wie der Header es formuliert |
| `directional` | `vTerrainLambert` — eine vertex-interpolierte Summe von `max(0, dot(normal, lightDirection)) × intensity` über die Richtlichter der Szene (Formel in §54); 0, wenn die Szene keine hat |
| `ambient` | `material.ambientAndCutoff.xyz × uniforms.sceneAmbient` — pro Material, pro Frame |
| `blockLight` | das `.rgb` des dekodierten Lichtlevel-Varyings (Dekodierung in §54) |
| `skyLight` | der Himmelskanal desselben Lichtlevel-Varyings — *"Voxel sky light, tone-mapped; 1 without BLOXD_LIGHTING"* (Header-Text) |
| `ambientLightColour` / `skyLightColour` | `uniforms.uAmbientLightColour` / `uniforms.uSkyLightColour` |
| `heldLight` | der Term des gehaltenen Lichts, gebaut aus dem w-Kanal des Lichtlevel-Varyings zusammen mit den Frame-Uniforms `uHeldLightPos` / `uHeldLightColour` ([Teil VII](../internals/) §26 dokumentiert Abfall und Kanal-Floor-Verhalten) |
| `fogColour` | `select(vec3f(0.0), uniforms.vFogColor, uniforms.vFogInfos.x != 0.0)` — **nur in einer Szene ganz ohne Fog schwarz** (Modus 0, §50) |
| `fogVisibility` | der geclampte Fog-Koeffizient — exakt der Wert, den die Funktion aus §50 zurückgibt |
| `position` / `normal` | die Varyings `vPositionW` / `vNormalW` (Normale pro Fragment renormalisiert) |
| `blockFlags` | das flache Varying `vBlockFlags` — vollständiger Übertragungsweg in §52 |

Zur Orientierung beim Lesen älteren Materials: Die identische Einfügearchitektur existierte im v2-Renderer, und die einzigen Integrationsunterschiede von v3 sind `vBlockId` → `vBlockFlags` und die hinzugekommenen Flüssigkeitsvarianten. Das Hook-System ist über den Bruch v2 → v3 hinweg architektonisch stabil.

### 50. Die Fog-Funktion: vier Modi, ein Feld

Wortgetreu aus dem Produktions-Terrain-Shader restauriert:

```wgsl
fn calcFogFactor(fogDistance: vec3f) -> f32 {
    var fogCoeff: f32 = 1.0;
    let fogStart   = uniforms.vFogInfos.y;
    let fogEnd     = uniforms.vFogInfos.z;
    let fogDensity = uniforms.vFogInfos.w;
    let dist = length(fogDistance);
    if (uniforms.vFogInfos.x == 3.0) {        // linear
        fogCoeff = (fogEnd - dist) / (fogEnd - fogStart);
    } else if (uniforms.vFogInfos.x == 1.0) { // exponentiell
        fogCoeff = 1.0 / pow(2.71828, dist * fogDensity);
    } else if (uniforms.vFogInfos.x == 2.0) { // exponentiell zum Quadrat
        fogCoeff = 1.0 / pow(2.71828, dist * dist * fogDensity * fogDensity);
    }                                          // 0.0 = Fog aus (Koeffizient bleibt 1.0)
    return clamp(fogCoeff, 0.0, 1.0);
}
```

- `vFogInfos = vec4f(mode, start, end, density)` — ein einziges vec4 steuert alles.
- **Im Shader existieren vier Modi: 0 = aus, 1 = exponentiell, 2 = exponentiell zum Quadrat, 3 = linear.** `fogVisibility` ist der geclampte Koeffizient, welcher Modus auch läuft — es gibt genau ein Feld, und kein Modus-Flag wird jemals an Pakete exponiert.
- Bloxds eigene Titel fahren Modus 3 (linear) mit dem 32-Block-Band aus [Teil VII](../internals/) §25 (`fogStart = 32 × D`, `fogEnd = 32 × (D + 1)`), daher beschreibt die Beobachtung „immer linear“ aus jenem Teil weiterhin das ausgelieferte Spielgeschehen. Die exponentiellen Modi sind jedoch echter, aktiver Engine-Code — ein Titel kann `vFogInfos.x` umschalten und die Rampe ohne jegliches Client-Update ändern. Distanzrezepte, die `distance(l.position, bloxdEyePosition())` selbst berechnen (Rezept R-B), sind der robuste Weg für distanzgetriebene Looks, da sie durch einen Moduswechsel nicht verschoben werden können.
- Damit ist die Frage „welche Fog-Rampe die Engine tatsächlich verwendet“ aus dem Quellcode geklärt: Alle vier sind implementiert; ausgelieferte Titel nutzen linear. (Dieselbe Funktion erklärt auch den fogColour-Kommentar des Headers — Modus 0 ist der einzige Fall, in dem `fogColour` schwarz ankommt, und Bloxds Spiele liefern nie Modus 0 aus; sie schieben den Fog stattdessen weit nach außen, [Teil VII](../internals/) §25.)

### 51. bloxdOpaqueBehind(): die exakte Implementierung

Die vollständige Funktion, wortgetreu aus dem Produktions-Build restauriert:

```wgsl
@group(3) @binding(1) var bloxdSpSceneDepth: texture_2d<f32>;
var<private> bloxdSpPixel: vec2i;
var<private> bloxdSpPositionW: vec3f;

fn bloxdOpaqueBehind() -> BloxdOpaqueBehind {
    let bloxdSpZ = textureLoad(bloxdSpSceneDepth, bloxdSpPixel, 0).r;
    if (bloxdSpZ <= 0.0) {
        return BloxdOpaqueBehind(false, vec3f(0.0), 0.0);
    }
    let bloxdSpEye = bloxdPackInputs.eyePosition;
    let bloxdSpScale = max(bloxdSpZ / (scene.view * vec4f(bloxdSpPositionW, 1.0)).z, 1.0);
    let bloxdSpBehind = bloxdSpEye + (bloxdSpPositionW - bloxdSpEye) * bloxdSpScale;
    return BloxdOpaqueBehind(true, bloxdSpBehind, distance(bloxdSpBehind, bloxdSpEye));
}
```

- **Die Tiefentextur liegt bei `@group(3) @binding(1)`** — Gruppe 3 ist die eigene Gruppe des Pakets: Binding 0 ist das 64-Byte-Uniform `bloxdPackInputs` (§41), Binding 1 ist diese Tiefentextur. Beide werden von der Engine bereitgestellt und können von deiner Seite nicht benannt werden.
- **Die Tiefentextur ist eine unfilterable-float-Ressource nur für Fragments.** Das Bind-Group-Layout registriert sie als `texture: { sampleType: "unfilterable-float" }` allein mit `GPUShaderStage.FRAGMENT`-Sichtbarkeit — genau deshalb baut `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` auf `textureLoad` (explizite Texel-Koordinaten, Mip-Level 0) statt auf `textureSample`: Hardware-Filterung ist bei dieser Textur schlicht nicht verfügbar.
- `z ≤ 0` bedeutet, dass die Tiefenprobe nichts getroffen hat (ferne Ebene / Himmel): `found = false`, und `position` / `distance` sind bedeutungslos — prüfe immer zuerst `found`.
- Die zurückgegebene Position ist ein **skalierter Strahlschnittpunkt**: Die opake Oberfläche wird bei `eye + (fragment − eye) × max(z / viewDepth, 1)` platziert. `distance` wird vom Auge zu diesem Punkt gemessen — für Wasseroberflächen-Pakete ist das effektiv „wie viel Wasser der Strahl durchquert hat, bevor er auf etwas Festes traf“, was tiefengetönte Wasserrezepte ohne zweiten Tiefenpuffer möglich macht.

### 52. blockFlags von Ende zu Ende: von der Registrierung bis zu deinem Hook

§42 erklärt, was die Bits bedeuten. Dieser Abschnitt ist der vollständige Weg, den ein Flag-Bit von der Blockregistrierung bis zu deinem Hook zurücklegt — jede Station aus der Produktionsquelle bestätigt, was zugleich die Aussage „the same across the face“ des Headers bis auf Byte-Ebene belegt.

**1. Registrierung (Blockdefinitions-Datenbank).** Die Flags jedes Blocks werden einmal bei der Registrierung berechnet:

```js
flags[id] = nameFlags                     // Regeln für Anzeigenamen (§42): Vegetation / Dirt / Sand / Gestein
          | (definition.opaque === true ? 1 : 0)   // Opak-Bit — Opazitätsdaten der Engine
          | (anyFaceEmission >= 1       ? 2 : 0);  // Emissions-Bit — Blocklicht-Emissionsdaten
```

Die Anzeigenamen-Regeln decken nur die vier Material-Bits ab; die beiden physikalischen Bits stammen aus separaten Engine-Daten — `opaque` direkt aus der Blockdefinition, `emissive` aus dem Emissionsarray für Blocklicht pro Fläche. Das „Glowing ores count, however faint“ des Headers ist wörtlich gemeint: Jede Fläche mit Emission ≥ 1 setzt das Bit.

**2. Pro Block → pro Material (Initialisierung des Meshers).** Terrain wird pro *Material* gezeichnet, nicht pro Block-ID, daher werden die Flags in eine Materialtabelle umtabelliert (ein `Uint16Array`, indexiert nach Material-ID; jedes Material übernimmt die Flags der ersten Fläche seines Besitzerblocks). Die Tabelle geht an den Meshing-Web-Worker — aber **nur in Konfigurationen, in denen die Paket-Pipeline aktiviert ist**; andernfalls ist die Tabelle `null` und es werden nie Flag-Bytes geschrieben. Spieler ohne Pakete zahlen konstruktionsbedingt null Overhead.

**3. In die Vertex-Bytes (Mesher-Worker).** Die Flags reiten in zwei freien Bytes der vorhandenen verschachtelten Vertex-Daten:

```js
addBlockFlagValues(buffer, stride, faceIndex, flags) {
    for (var base = 4*faceIndex*stride, v = 0; v < 4; v++) {
        var o = base + v*stride;
        buffer[o + colorOffset  + 3] = 255 & flags;   // niedrige 8 Bits → Alpha-Byte des Farbattributs
        buffer[o + normalOffset + 3] = flags >> 8;    // hohe 8 Bits → w-Byte des Normalenattributs
    }
}
```

Alle vier Vertices einer Fläche erhalten denselben Wert — die Bedeutung von „the same across the face“ auf Implementierungsebene.

**4. Dekodierung auf der GPU (Lite-Terrain-Shader).** Die zwei Bytes reisen als Vertex-Attribut `blockFlagWords: vec2u` (Location 7, nur vorhanden, wenn die Paket-Pipeline an ist) und werden in der Vertex-Stufe wieder zusammengesetzt:

```wgsl
vertexOutputs.vBlockFlags = ((vertexInputs.blockFlagWords.x >> 24u) << 8u)
                          |  (vertexInputs.blockFlagWords.y >> 24u);
```

`vBlockFlags` ist als `@interpolate(flat)` deklariert — pro Fläche konstant bis in die Fragment-Stufe, weshalb die Bittests aus §42 innerhalb einer Fläche stabil sind und nie einen Blend mitten in einer Fläche erzeugen können.

- Die Pipeline reserviert **16 Bits** Kapazität (diese Dekodierung setzt zwei volle Bytes zusammen), während v3 nur 6 definiert — künftige Flags können ohne weitere Vertex-Format-Änderung oder API-Sprung erscheinen.
- Im Packed-Vertex-Modus reisen dieselben zwei Bytes in `packed.y` und dem oberen Byte des Farbworts statt in einem dedizierten Attribut — gleiche Werte, anderer Container.
- Zur Blätter-gegen-Gras-Frage, zu der diese Flags am häufigsten befragt werden, siehe [Blätter ohne das Gras](#blätter-ohne-das-gras-die-frage-die-alle-stellen) unter §42.

### 53. Interna der Validierung: HEADER_VERSION, Signaturen, reservierte Namen

**Der gemessene Header-Hash.** Jede Paketvalidierung wird mit dem `HEADER_VERSION` der Engine gestempelt. Das Produktions-Validierungsmodul direkt auszuführen (siehe Harness-Hinweis am Ende von §54) misst ihn:

```
v2 (sjr0p7):  6.bc5e8338
v3 (3ymzdd):  6.5bc26a63   ← aus dem Live-Produktions-Bundle gemessen
```

Es ist ein FNV-1a-32-Hash (Präfix `6.`) über fünf Eingaben: den Engine-Header, vorverarbeitet und **pro Variante** tokenisiert (ein Eintrag für jede der 8 Varianten), das vollständige lexikalische WGSL-Universum des Parsers, die vier Makronamen, die Tabelle der Spezialfunktionen und die Deklaration `BloxdPackInputs` zusammen mit ihrer Uniform-Zeile `@group(3) @binding(0)`. Zwei Konsequenzen für Autoren:

- **Jede Header-Änderung auf Engine-Seite berechnet ihn neu** — das ist der Mechanismus hinter dem automatischen „muss erneut geprüft werden“, das gespeicherte Pakete nach Engine-Updates erhalten ([Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) §31).
- Der Hash deckt den *Engine-Header* ab, nicht deinen Code. Ein Paket, das nach einem Engine-Update weiter lädt, ist nicht „noch gültig“ — es hat nur noch keine Header-Änderung ausgelöst. Die einzige Versionsprüfung, an der dein Manifest teilnimmt, ist das `apiVersion`-Gate (§40).

**Hook-Signaturprüfung: token-genau bei Typen, frei bei Namen.** Der Validator hält eine Signatur pro Hook-Slot:

```js
{
  vertex:  { params: [{ type: "BloxdVertexIn" }],                      returns: "BloxdVertex"  },
  surface: { params: [{ type: "BloxdSurfaceIn" }],                     returns: "BloxdSurface" },
  light:   { params: [{ type: "BloxdSurface" }, { type: "BloxdLightIn" }], returns: "BloxdLight" }
}
```

Der Abgleich erfolgt **Token für Token**: Parametertypnamen müssen exakt passen, `->` und der Rückgabetyp müssen exakt passen, und Parameteranzahl sowie Kommaplatzierung werden geprüft. Parameter*namen* sind frei — jeder Bezeichner an der Parameterposition wird akzeptiert, weshalb dein `fn bloxdTerrainLight(s, l)` kompiliert, obwohl das Template `(surface, light)` schreibt. Der Light-Hook nimmt genau zwei Parameter.

**Reservierte Namen.** Die Regel ist eine einzige Regex: `/^bloxd/i`. Jeder Bezeichner, der mit `bloxd` beginnt, ist reserviert — alles `bloxd*` wird von der Engine bereitgestellt, und ein Paket kann nicht in diesen Namensraum deklarieren (deshalb kollidieren auch die `bloxdPi` / `bloxdTau`-Neudeklarationen aus §44).

**Spezialfunktionen.** Genau eine ist in v3 registriert:

```js
["bloxdOpaqueBehind", { returns: "BloxdOpaqueBehind", symbol: "BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH" }]
```

„Spezial“ bedeutet *an ein Makro gebunden* — eine Engine-Funktion, deren Verfügbarkeit von einem Variantensymbol abhängt. Zwei Guard-Diagnosen erzwingen den korrekten Einsatz:

> `${vertexHook} reaches ${name}, which only surface and light hooks can use.` — ein Vertex-Hook erreicht eine Funktion, die nur Surface- und Light-Hooks nutzen können.
>
> `${hook} reaches ${name}, which needs ${symbol}, but this hook also runs on ${program}, which doesn't define it; guard the call with #ifdef ${symbol}.` — zum Beispiel terrain-seitiges `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` ohne `#ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH`-Wrap.

**Der Engine-Header (Präludium), festgeschrieben.** Der v3-Header ist eine 5.637-Byte-Zeichenkette, die mit `// Engine-provided and read-only, prepended to all packs. apiVersion 3.` beginnt. Er trägt `#if` / `#ifdef`-Direktiven, die der WGSL-Präprozessor der Engine selbst pro Variante auswertet — die Engine führt tatsächlich die Auswertung von `#if`-Ausdrücken aus, und ein fehlerhafter Ausdruck endet mit `Cannot evaluate #if ...`. Jede Struktur, jede Funktionssignatur und jeder zitierte Kommentar in dieser Anleitung stammt aus diesem gerenderten Text, daher können Anleitung und ausgelieferter Header nicht auseinanderlaufen. Der vollständige Text folgt wortgetreu am Ende von §54.

**Parser-Hinweise für Autoren.**

- Paketseitige Funktionen werden beim Verschmelzen in den Engine-Shader mit dem Präfix `pack_` umbenannt (Kollisionsvermeidung); Diagnosen führen sie auf deine ursprünglichen Namen zurück — derselbe Mechanismus, den [Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) §38 für die zweite Validierungsstufe beschreibt.
- Die Meldung für nicht deklarierte Bezeichner lautet `'${name}' isn't declared. Packs can use their own names, WGSL built-ins and the Bloxd header.`; `_ can only be the target of a phony assignment, as in _ = f();` und `'${name}' is a WGSL keyword or reserved word, so it can't be a member name.` vervollständigen die neu bestätigte Menge.
- Das lexikalische Universum des Parsers enthält Bezeichner, die **kein Standard-WGSL** sind: `bufferView`, `bufferArrayView`, `bufferLength`, `atomicStoreMax`, `atomicStoreMin`. Die Engine kennt sie als Built-ins, aber ob die WGSL-Implementierung eines bestimmten Browsers sie bereitstellt, ist nicht garantiert — baue niemals ein Vertriebspaket darauf auf.

### 54. Bestätigte Konstanten, Limits und Layouts

Das vollständige Ressourcenlayout des Terrain-Programms, direkt aus dem Produktions-Lite-Renderer:

| Binding | Inhalt |
|---|---|
| `@group(0) @binding(0)` | `scene`: `LiteSceneUniforms` — `viewProjection` mat4x4f, `view` mat4x4f, `vEyePosition` |
| `@group(1) @binding(0)` | `uniforms`: `TerrainFrameUniforms` — `uHeldLightColour` / `uHeldLightPos`, `uSkyLightColour`, `uAmbientLightColour`, **`vFogInfos`**, `vFogColor`, `outputHeight`, `sceneAmbient`, **`uDirLights: array<vec4f, 4>`** |
| `@group(1) @binding(1)` | `chunks`: Storage `array<vec4f>` — xyz = Übersetzung in den Render-Frame, w = Sichtbarkeit beim Einblenden |
| `@group(2) @binding(0)` | `material`: `vDiffuseColor`, `ambientAndCutoff`, `emissiveAndLevel`, `anim` |
| `@group(3) @binding(0)` | `bloxdPackInputs` — das Paket-Uniform (§41) |
| `@group(3) @binding(1)` | `bloxdSpSceneDepth` — die Tiefentextur (§51) |

- **Richtlichter sind hart auf vier begrenzt.** Der Renderer bricht mit `Terrain supports 4 directional lights, not ${n}` ab, wenn eine Szene mehr registrieren will. `l.directional` ist die summierte Lambert-Beleuchtung über alle vorhandenen (0–4; Bloxds eigene Szenen nutzen 2 — [Teil VII](../internals/) §27). Terrain warnt außerdem über Lichter, die es nicht berücksichtigen kann, wortlautgetreu: ein nachträglich hinzugefügtes Licht — `Light "…" was added to the scene after startup; terrain and block models will ignore it. Add it in _initScene, alongside rendering.dirLights.`; ein getöntes — `Terrain directional light "…" is tinted (r, g, b); the per-vertex Lambert term carries one scalar per light and will render it as white.`; und ein mesh-filterndes — `Terrain directional light "…" filters which meshes it affects; the per-vertex Lambert term is written per material and cannot honour that, so terrain ignores it.`
- **Benennung des Terrain-Programms**: Pipeline-Cache-Keys lauten `terrain-{texture}{-anim}{-test}{-lit}-dir{dirLightCount}{-packed}{-sp{packVariant}}{-liquid}` — ein Paket erscheint als Suffix `-sp{variant}`, ein Programm pro Variante aus §46. Ein Watcher (`watchPipelineFailures`) gleicht Live-Pipeline-Namen gegen `/^terrain-.*?(-lit)?-dir\d+(?:-packed)?-sp(\d+)(?:-liquid)?$/` ab und prüft die passende Paketvariante erneut, wenn eine Pipeline-Kompilierung fehlschlägt; bei GPU-Device-Verlust (`device.lost`) wird die Prüfung übersprungen.
- **`BLOXD_TERRAIN_DIRECTIONAL` ist ein engine-internes Makro** (definiert, wenn dirLightCount > 0). Es ist *nicht* eines der vier aus dem Präludium und erreicht nie Paketcode — aber es erscheint in WGSL-Dumps der Engine-eigenen Shader, daher spart das Erkennen Verwirrung.
- **Dekodierung des Lichtlevels**: Das Vertex-Attribut `aPackedLightLevels` ist ein f32, das vier Nibbles packt, jeweils durch 15 geteilt: rgb = das farbige Blocklicht, a = der Himmel-/Handlicht-Kanal. Die Vertex-Stufe dekodiert es in das Varying `vLightLevels`; `blockLight` liest `.rgb`, der Himmel-/Handlicht-Kanal liest `.w`. Die Engine legt die rgb-Kanäle vor der Interpolation auf mindestens 35 % des hellsten Kanals — der engine-seitige Anker des Lifts, den [Teil VII](../internals/) §26 aus dem Gameplay dokumentiert.
- **`vTerrainLambert`** (die Quelle von `directional`, §49) wird als Summe über die aktiven Richtlichter erzeugt: `max(0.0, dot(vNormalW, uDirLights[i].xyz)) * uDirLights[i].w`, geschützt durch `BLOXD_TERRAIN_DIRECTIONAL`.
- **Indexpuffer werden beim ersten großen Mesh 32 Bit breit.** Der Lite-Renderer wählt `Uint16Array`-Indizes nur, solange jeder Indexwert ≤ 65.534 bleibt — sobald ein Index 65.535 erreicht, wird der Puffer ein `Uint32Array` (pro Puffer über ein `is32Bits`-Flag verfolgt). Praktisch: Ein Chunk-Mesh mit höchstens 65.535 Vertices passt in 16-Bit-Indizes; eines mit genau 65.536 Vertices erzeugt zwangsläufig einen Index von 65.535 und schaltet den ganzen Puffer auf 32 Bit.
- **Details des Manifest-Ladens**: Zip-Einträge unter `__MACOSX/`, Dateien mit Präfix `._` und `.DS_Store` werden herausgefiltert (macOS-Archivrauschen); `pack.json` wird per kleingeschriebenem Pfadvergleich gefunden — null Treffer → `loadNoManifest`, zwei oder mehr → `loadDuplicateManifest`; das Lesen des Manifests ist auf 65.536 Bytes begrenzt.
- **Wie all das verifiziert wurde**: Die Module des Produktions-Bundles wurden restauriert (165 Chunks; die webpack-Registry zählt in diesem Bundle 4.951 Module — die Modulzahl verschiebt sich um einige, je nachdem ob asynchrone Kind-Abhängigkeiten mitgezählt werden, daher die exakte Zahl als bundle-spezifisch behandeln) und in einem webpack-kompatiblen Harness unter Node.js ausgeführt. Der gemessene `HEADER_VERSION` (§53), der gerenderte 5.637-Byte-Header, die kanonische Reihenfolge der Variantentabelle und die Tabelle der Spezialfunktionen stammen alle aus *der Ausführung des ausgelieferten Codes*, nicht aus dem Lesen von Zeichenketten. Derselbe Harness ist der natürliche Kern für ein Community-`pack_check` v6 — den Validator der Engine selbst gegen ein Paket auszuführen reproduziert exakt seine Ergebnisse.
#### Der v3-Engine-Header, wortgetreu

Der festgeschriebene 5.637-Byte-Text (127 Zeilen) selbst — das Artefakt, das §53 oben beschreibt — wortgetreu restauriert aus Build `3ymzdd`, dem v3-Produktions-Build dieses Teils. Er ist das v3-Gegenstück zum v4-Header aus [Teil XI](../api/texture-catalog.md) §67 und wird aus demselben Grund vollständig eingebettet: Ein v3-Pack lässt sich gegen exakt den Text debuggen, den die Engine voranstellte, und jede v3-→-v4-Differenz ([Teil X](../history/v4.md) §58–§59) lässt sich aus beiden Texten direkt ablesen.

## Teil X: Migrationsleitfaden für API Version 4 (2026-10-26, Zusammenfassung)

> **Seit 2026-11-03 ersetzt: die aktuelle API ist Version 5** — v4-Pakete werden beim Laden genau so abgelehnt, wie es hier für v3 beschrieben ist. Wende diesen Teil an *und dann* [Teil XII](../history/v5.md) (v4 → v5: die `BloxdFlags`-Struktur ersetzt `blockFlags`, `bloxdLit()` und das öffentliche Beleuchtungsrezept, die Enchant-/Overlay-Eingaben, das 9-Hook-Standardpaket). Die Interna dieses Teils (§56–§66) bleiben für die v4-Builds, auf denen sie gemessen wurden, korrekt.

> Dieser Text ist die kurze Zusammenfassung für diese Sprache. Die vollständige Fassung mit allen Details, Beispielrezepten und restaurierten Engine-Interna (§55–§66) gibt es auf [Englisch](https://github.com/imu31465/Bloxd.io-How-To-Make-Shader-Packs/blob/main/en/10-apiv4.md) und [Japanisch](https://github.com/imu31465/Bloxd.io-How-To-Make-Shader-Packs/blob/main/ja/10-apiv4.md).

Ziel-Build: `cnty9.main.669f8081.js` — **seit 2026-10-26 gleichzeitig in Produktion und Preprod live** (beide byte-identisch). Das Pack-Modell behält seine Form: gleiche `pack.json`-Felder, gleiche Loader-Limits, gleiches 64-B-Uniform, dieselben 6 Hooks.

Erneut am `tcwczu.main.357faec1.js` verifiziert (2026-10-30, Produktion und Preprod wieder byte-identisch): **die gesamte v4-API ist unverändert** — Header, Standard-Pack-Vorlage, die 27 `bloxdSp*`-Symbole, Loader-Limits und die 12 Allow-Titel sind byte-identisch mit der hier dokumentierten `cnty9`-Basis. Das Bundle-Layout wurde erneut umgebaut (Cluster jetzt u. a. c51–c56), für Packs ändert sich nichts; die Texturnamen-Registry wurde nicht neu vermessen (Namen bleiben die stabile API).

### Was sich ändert

- `pack.json` verlangt `"apiVersion": 4` (strikt `===`, Zahl) — v3-Pakete werden beim Laden abgelehnt.
- **Neue Textur-API (das Highlight):** `bloxdTexel(textureId, uv, mipLevel) -> vec4f` sampelt den Block-Textur-Atlas genau wie die Engine selbst (id 0 = weiß; animierte Texturen liefern automatisch den aktuellen Frame), `bloxdTextureSize(mipLevel) -> vec2u`, und benannte Konstanten `bloxdTextureId*` (CamelCase aus dem Dateinamen, z. B. `grass_top` → `bloxdTextureIdGrassTop`; der vollständige Katalog aller 905 nutzbaren Namen ist als §68 in Teil XI (`11-reference.md`) eingebettet).
- **Vier neue Eingabefelder** in `BloxdSurfaceIn` *und* `BloxdLightIn`: `textureId`, `textureRotation` (Vierteldrehungen im Uhrzeigersinn, die `bloxdTexel` anwendet), `uv` (in Blöcken; `fract(uv)` wird gezeichnet), `mipLevel`.
- **Umbenennungen mit Bedeutungswechsel:** `fogVisibility` → `fogAlpha` mit **invertierter** Bedeutung (`0 = kein Nebel, 1 = nur fogColour`; Port: `l.fogVisibility` → `1.0 - l.fogAlpha`); `bloxdFaceBlock()` → `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition()` (identischer Körper); `BloxdOpaqueBehind.found` → `hit`.
- **Strict Games werden jetzt vom eingebauten Validator durchgesetzt:** ein ungeschützter Vertex-Hook oder ein erreichbares `discard` meldet `... moves terrain, which strict games prevent.` / `... makes terrain see-through, ...` und deaktiviert **alle** Hooks in Strict-Spielen. Mit `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT`-Wrappern laufen Surface/Light weiter.
- Alles andere bleibt eingefroren: 6 Hooks, `blockFlags`-Bits (1/2/4/8/16/32), Uniform-Layout, Loader-Limits, Varianten-Matrix, die 12 Allow-Titel (auf `cnty9` am 2026-10-27 unverändert bestätigt).

### Migration in Kürze

| v3 | v4 |
|---|---|
| `"apiVersion": 3` | `"apiVersion": 4` (Zahl) |
| `l.fogVisibility` | `1.0 - l.fogAlpha` |
| `mix(l.fogColour, col, VIS)` | `mix(col, l.fogColour, ALPHA)` bzw. `bloxdApplyFog(col, l)` |
| `bloxdFaceBlock(pos, nrm)` | `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition(pos, nrm)` |
| `behind.found` | `behind.hit` |
| Vertex-Hooks ungeschützt | `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT ... #endif` |

Das komplette Referenzmaterial ist ab sofort Teil des Handbuchs: der restaurierte Engine-Header im Volltext und der komplette Textur-Katalog mit allen 905 nutzbaren Namen stehen in Teil XI (`11-reference.md`). Die vollständigen Details — Rotations-Feinheit von `bloxdTexel`, das restaurierte Sampling-`WGSL`, die Namens-Registry, die neue `HEADER_VERSION`-Struktur mit Registry-Hash — stehen in der englischen und japanischen Vollfassung.

### 67. Der vollständige v4-Engine-Header, wortgetreu

Der 6.021-Byte-Header (150 Zeilen), den die Engine jedem Pack voranstellt — beginnend mit `// The Bloxd shader pack API, apiVersion 4. Read-only, prepended to all packs.` Nicht enthalten: das pro Renderer-Konfiguration generierte Paar `bloxdTexel`/`bloxdTextureSize` (§63.1) und die 27 `bloxdSp*`-Symbole (§63.4). Das `#ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA`-Gatter löst der Präprozessor der Engine pro Variante auf.

## Teil XII: Migrationsleitfaden für API Version 5 (2026-11-03, Zusammenfassung)

Die vollständige Fassung mit allen Details, Beispielrezepten, dem restaurierten v5-Header im Volltext und den Engine-Interna (§69–§82) gibt es auf [Englisch](https://github.com/imu31465/Bloxd.io-How-To-Make-Shader-Packs/blob/main/en/12-apiv5.md) und [Japanisch](https://github.com/imu31465/Bloxd.io-How-To-Make-Shader-Packs/blob/main/ja/12-apiv5.md).

Ziel-Build: `ab90qa.main.6188124c.js` — **seit Messung am 2026-11-03 gleichzeitig in Produktion und Preprod live** (beide byte-identisch, md5-verifiziert). Dies ist die größte API-Revision seit v3: der dekodierte Engine-Header wächst von 6,021 auf **8,954 Byte**, und fast jede Struktur erhält neue Felder.

### Was sich ändert

- `pack.json` verlangt `"apiVersion": 5` (strikt `===`, Zahl) — v4-Pakete werden beim Laden abgelehnt; gespeicherte v4-Pakete sind still inaktiv.
- **`blockFlags` wird durch eine Struktur ersetzt (die große Umstellung):** die sechs Bit-Konstanten `bloxdBlockFlag*` (opaque/emissive/vegetation/dirt/sand/rock) entfallen; stattdessen **`flags: BloxdFlags`** mit 14 benannten bool-Feldern — sechs davon sind die alten Bits unter neuem Namen, acht sind neu: **`slab` `stairs` `flat` `placed` `held` `dropped` `thrown` `lifeform`**. Modelle, gehaltene Items und Lebewesen sind jetzt von Terrain unterscheidbar.
- **`#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` ist entfernt:** der Kompilier-Schalter weicht einem Laufzeittest mit der neuen Header-Funktion **`bloxdLit()`**; das Uniform erhält das Feld `lit: u32` (Offset 4, weiterhin 64 B gesamt). Die Variantenmatrix schrumpft von 8 auf 6 (`strict|allow` × `terrain|liquid|model`).
- **Die Beleuchtungsrezept der Engine wird öffentlich:** drei neue Header-Funktionen — **`bloxdShading(light)`**, **`bloxdWorldLight(light)`**, **`bloxdLitColour(surface, light)`** — plus zwei neue `BloxdLightIn`-Eingaben (`diffuse`, `emissive`).
- **Neue Eingaben:** `localPosition: vec3f` (Modellkoordinaten, 0 für Terrain) überall; `enchantTier` / `enchantColour` / `enchantSpeed` / `overlayColour` (Verzauberung und Treffer-Blitz) auf Surface/Light; **neue Ausgaben** `enchantColour` / `overlayColour` auf `BloxdSurface`, die `bloxdLitColour` einmischt.
- **Entfernt:** `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition()` (ohne Ersatz), die `bloxdBlockFlag*`-Konstanten, `bloxdSpLitColour`.
- **Die Standard-Pack-Vorlage liefert jetzt alle 9 Hooks** (Light-Hooks inklusive, 1,122 → 1,683 Byte) — und der neue Kommentar dokumentiert das Lösch-Modell: *„If you delete a hook, the default is used instead."*
- Neu im Header: `const bloxdChunkSize: i32 = 32;`. Der Y-Ableitungs-Schutz wird automatisiert: `dpdy`/`dpdyCoarse`/`dpdyFine` schreibt die Engine als `(-dpdy(...))` um. `HEADER_VERSION` steigt auf `9.<hash>.<hash>`.
- `bloxdSp*`-Namespace wächst von 27 auf **46 Symbole**; die Texturnamen-Registry misst jetzt **896 nutzbare Namen** (+1 `scorpion_eggs`, −10 u. a. die `chest_double_*`-Familie und `mob_spawner_*_block_side`) — Namen sind die API, ids nur Snapshot.
- Alles andere bleibt eingefroren: Loader-Limits (256 `.wgsl` / 256 KB / 64 KB / 32 MB / 1,024 Einträge), Hook-Namen, Strict-Vertrag (allow 12 Titel), Group-3-Bindungen.

### Migration in Kürze

| v4 | v5 |
|---|---|
| `"apiVersion": 4` | `"apiVersion": 5` (Zahl) |
| `(s.blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagVegetation) != 0u` | `s.flags.vegetation` |
| `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING … #endif` | `if (bloxdLit()) { … } else { return bloxdDefaultLight(s, l); }` |
| `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition(p, n)` | entfallen — `bloxdWorldPosition()` / `flags` verwenden |
| (nicht vorhanden) | `s.flags.held`, `s.flags.lifeform`, `s.localPosition`, `s.enchantTier` … |

Der vollständige restaurierte v5-Engine-Header (8,954 Byte, Wort für Wort) und die komplette Drift-Liste der Texturnamen stehen in der englischen und japanischen Vollfassung (§82 bzw. §80).

## Engine-Standardlicht und Realismus-Spielraum



Das Engine-Standardlicht ist „nur Multiplikation" — kein Specular, Fresnel, Warm-Kalt-Trennung oder Hemisphären-Ambiente existiert. Folgendes lässt sich neu aufbauen:

| Feature | Standard | In Paketen baubar? |
|---|---|---|
| Diffus (Lambert) | Nur skalare Richtlicht-Summe | ◎ Eigen mit `bloxdSunDirection()` (Wrap-Quellen etc.) |
| Specular | Keins | ◎ Blinn-Phong (R9.2) |
| Fresnel | Keins | ◎ Schlick-Näherung (R9.3) |
| Warme Fackel / kaltes Himmelslicht-Trennung | Farblos | ◎ (R9.1) |
| Hemisphären-Ambiente | Richtungslos | ◎ Himmel oben / Boden unten (R9.4) |
| Tonemapping | Keins (nur clamp) | ◎ ACES-Filmic (R9.5) |
| Luftperspektive | Nur Fog (Farbtausch) | ◎ Distanz-Entsättigung (R9.6) |
| Oberflächendetail | Nur Texturauflösung | △ Prozedurales Hash-Mikro-Bump (R9.8) |
| Vertex-Wellen (Wasser) | Keine (flach) | ◎ Nur allow (R7) |
| Wellennormalen / Sonnenglitzer | Keine | ◎ (R9.7) |
| Nachtmondlicht | Himmelsfarbe dunkelt nur ab | △ Mondrichtung liegt in `-bloxdSunDirection()`: Pseudo-Looks (blaues Ambiente in R2 / Entsättigung in R9.11) plus gerichtetes Mondlicht (R-A, nur Tag/Nacht-Zyklus) |
| Schatten (Himmelsverdeckung) | Nur sanftes Mischen via `mix(Ambiente, Himmel, skyLight)` | ◎ Lift-Inversion + Schwellenwert-Schnitt + Sonnen-Gate (R9.12). Baumschatten und Dachschatten fallen klar und folgen Block-Edits in Echtzeit |

## Shadows

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Verified (LightEngine behavior unchanged since v4 measurement)

The three ways to make "shadows" in a shader pack, and their limits.

### Can / cannot

| Effect | Possible? | How |
|---|---|---|
| Clearly darken under trees/roofs (projected-style) | ◎ | `skyLight` lift inversion + threshold cut (below) |
| Shadows follow block edits in real time | ◎ | LightEngine recalculates immediately — automatic |
| Color shadows cool / sunlit warm | ◎ | two-color shift |
| Shadows rotating with the sun (shadow map) | ✕ | depth is liquid-only; light-ray occlusion is not an input |
| Physical penumbra | ✕ | capped by voxel-resolution BFS spread |
| Real-time AO (SSAO) | ✕ | only the AO baked into vertex colors |

### skyLight is a voxel shadow map

`l.skyLight` is not just a brightness parameter. The mesher's LightEngine computes Minecraft-style **"can this position see the sky" voxel occlusion data — a shadow map**:

1. **Column scan**: each (x,z) column top-down; sky light starts at 15, hits 0 at opaque blocks, attenuates by `lightFilter` (air 1 / water 3 / opaque 15)
2. **BFS flood fill**: spreads horizontally to 6 neighbors (-1 per block) — this softens shadow edges. Under an occluder of radius r the raw value is (15-r)/15
3. blockLight (torches) is a separate RGB 3-channel (4-bit packed) BFS

Under trees, roofs and inside buildings the value is already low and interpolates smoothly per-vertex. Placing or breaking a block recalculates immediately — **real-time-following shadows**.

### The lift-curve trap

`l.skyLight` arrives **post-lift-curve** (`y = 1-(1-x/(3-2x))³`, an S-curve that lifts dark values):

| Place | Raw voxel | Lifted (= l.skyLight) | pow(·, 5.0) |
|---|---|---|---|
| open sky | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| under tree (radius 2) | 0.87 | **0.97** | **0.86** ← nearly kept |
| radius 3 | 0.80 | **0.92** | 0.66 |
| radius 5 | 0.67 | 0.78 | 0.29 |

**This is the proven root cause of "gamma doesn't darken shadows"** — even γ=5 only takes under-tree 0.97 down to 0.86.

### The fix: lift inversion + threshold cut

The curve is monotonic and inverts exactly: `c=(1-y)^(1/3); x=3(1-c)/(3-2c)`. Restore the raw value, then binarize with a **`smoothstep` threshold**. LightEngine's BFS spread is "-1 per adjacent block", so `th = 1 - r/15` is directly the "occlusion radius counted as shadow" dial.

The complete implementation (sun gating + warm/cool split + blockLight passthrough) is in [realism recipes](../recipes/realism.md). Key steps:

```wgsl
// 1. restore the raw value (skipping this means shadows never appear)
let skyRaw = sh_unlift(l.skyLight);
// 2. threshold-cut — sunlit 1 / shadow 0
let sky = smoothstep(shTh - shSoft, shTh + shSoft, skyRaw);
// the essence of projection: direct sun only reaches places that see the sky
let lit = sunL * sky;
```

Dials: **area** = `shTh` (0.93→radius 1.5 / 0.87→2 / 0.80→3 / 0.67→5); **edge softness** = `shSoft`; **core darkness** = the minimum ambient and sky-scatter two-point shift; long evening shadows ≈ `thEff = shTh + 0.10 * (1 - clamp(sunDir.y, 0.0, 1.0))`.

### Honest limits

- Shadows reference the **upward sky**, so they **do not rotate with the sun** (voxel resolution; soft edges come from BFS spread)
- The engine's lighting template retains an unused `var shadow: f32 = 1.;` (always 1.0 = disabled) — a plausible "future plans" trace for pixel-accurate rotating shadows
- Pixel-accurate rotating shadows are outside the current API ([Unreachable effects](constraints.md))

## Integriertes Rezept für natürlich aussehendes Wasser



Diese API kann die Szenenfarbe nicht sampeln: Es ist **Pseudo-Rendering per Fresnel-Farbmischung und Sonnen-Highlights, keine echte Reflexion/Refraktion**. Die Tiefenberechnung geht in v2 per `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` (ausgelagert in [Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) R-E). Das Sample behält die Basisfarbe, mischt bei streifenden Blickwinkeln etwas Richtung Himmelsfarbe und addiert nur mit Sonne einen kleinen Glint.

```wgsl
fn pack_waterWaveNormal(p: vec3f, t: f32) -> vec3f {
    let c1 = cos(p.x * 1.00 + t * 1.60);
    let c2 = cos(p.z * 1.35 + t * 1.28);
    let c3 = cos((p.x + p.z) * 0.70 - t * 1.76);
    let dhdx = 0.50 * c1 + 0.15 * 0.70 * c3;
    let dhdz = 0.35 * 1.35 * c2 + 0.15 * 0.70 * c3;
    return normalize(vec3f(-dhdx * 0.55, 1.0, -dhdz * 0.55));
}

fn bloxdLiquidLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let baseN = normalize(l.normal);
    let viewDir = normalize(bloxdEyePosition() - l.position);
    let facing = clamp(dot(baseN, viewDir), 0.0, 1.0);
    let fresnel = 0.02 + 0.98 * pow(1.0 - facing, 5.0);
    let fakeSkyReflection = vec3f(0.16, 0.29, 0.36);
    out.colour *= vec3f(0.88, 0.97, 1.04);
    out.colour = mix(out.colour, fakeSkyReflection, fresnel * 0.38);
    if (bloxdLit()) {
        let worldPos = bloxdWorldPosition(l.position);
        let topness = clamp(baseN.y * 2.0, 0.0, 1.0);
        let waveN = normalize(mix(baseN, pack_waterWaveNormal(worldPos, bloxdSeconds()), topness));
        let sunLen = length(bloxdSunDirection());
        if (sunLen > 0.5) {
            let sunDir = bloxdSunDirection() / sunLen;
            let halfDir = normalize(viewDir + sunDir);
            let glint = pow(max(dot(waveN, halfDir), 0.0), 180.0) * 0.55 * clamp(l.skyLight, 0.0, 1.0);
            out.colour += vec3f(1.0, 0.97, 0.90) * glint;
        }
}
    return out;
}
```

Tuning-Hinweise:

- Wasser weiß/ausgewaschen: `0.38` in `fresnel * 0.38` und Glint `0.55` senken.
- Wasser zu dunkel: etwas mehr `fakeSkyReflection` mischen. Zu viel wirkt plastisch.
- Linien oder regelmäßige Streifen auf Wasser: Wellenfrequenzen und Glint-Stärke senken. Dieser Code verschiebt keine Mesh-Vertices.
- Echte Landschaftsreflexionen: Diese API-Inputs haben keine Bildschirmfarbe: Farben zu mischen wird nie echte Reflexion (Tiefe ist in Flüssigkeiten abgreifbar. [Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) R-E).

Dieses Rezept **ersetzt** ein existierendes `bloxdLiquidLight`. Nicht neben die gleichnamige Wellenfunktion aus R9.7 oder andere gleichnamige Hooks kleben.


### Unterwasser-Realität mit Shader-Paketen



Unterwasser-Looks bestehen aus 3 Schichten:

| Schicht | Inhalt | Aus Paketen operierbar? |
|---|---|---|
| ① Terrain-/Flüssigkeits-Rendering | Per Hooks verarbeitbar. Light-Hooks laufen unter Wasser normal | Ja (wirkt „unterm Schleier") |
| ② Flüssigkeitsdefinitions-Schleier | Emissives Fullscreen-Quad aus Definitionsfarbe/-alpha des Flüssigkeitsblocks der Kamera, ganz vorne gezeichnet. Die Spieleinstellung `cameraTint` gewinnt, falls gesetzt | Nein (weder Farbe noch Dichte änderbar) |
| ③ cameraTint | Spieleinstellung | Nein |

Praktische Punkte: Pakete wirken auch unter Wasser weiter / der Schleier ist nicht entfernbar / unter Wasser ist keine Verzweigung möglich (fogStart / fogEnd / fogColour ändern sich unter Wasser nicht: fogVisibility erkennt es auch nicht).

## „Dunkle Schatten, aber helle Flächen" nachts beheben



Nur Schatten abzudunkeln lässt die fertige Farbe (`engineColour`) ohne Sonne hell, und die Flächen/Schatten-Lücke wird unnatürlich. Die ganze fertige Farbe dämpfen.

Das Beispiel behandelt `bloxdSunDirection()`-null als Nacht und gerichtete Sonne als Tag und dämpft Terrain-Endfarben in dunklen Stunden. Wo `blockLight` und `heldLight` stark sind, schwächt sich die Dämpfung, um nahe Lampen wie Fackeln zu erhalten. `0.52` ist ein Tuning-Wert — für dunklere Nächte senken.

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let sunPresent = smoothstep(0.0, 0.5, length(bloxdSunDirection()));
    let nightDim = mix(0.52, 1.0, sunPresent);
    var scale = nightDim;
    if (bloxdLit()) {
        let blockAmt = max(l.blockLight.r, max(l.blockLight.g, l.blockLight.b));
        let heldAmt = max(l.heldLight.r, max(l.heldLight.g, l.heldLight.b));
        let localLight = clamp(max(blockAmt, heldAmt), 0.0, 1.0);
        let protectLocalLight = smoothstep(0.03, 0.35, localLight);
        scale = mix(nightDim, 1.0, protectLocalLight);
}
    // fertige Farbe dämpfen; Material-Emission per Default mit Fog addieren
    out.colour = l.engineColour * scale + s.emission * (1.0 - l.fogAlpha);
    return out;
}
```

**Limits dieses Fixes:** Verhält sich `bloxdSunDirection()` wie „Einheitsrichtung mit Sonne, null ohne", lassen sich Tag/Nacht unterscheiden, aber Abendrot nicht weich schätzen. Und da es die fertige Farbe dämpft, schwächt es Engine-Tageslicht und -Ambiente zusammen — keine totale Tageszeit-Reproduktion. Für Flüssigkeiten dieselbe Liquid-Hook-Fallback-Beziehung prüfen.

## Models and textures

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Analyzed (restored from header & validator)

What the new v5 Model hooks draw and read.

### What the Model program draws

- **Block models**: half blocks (`slab`), stairs (`stairs`), crossed-plane plants — tall grass, flowers, crops, cobwebs (`flat`)
- **Items**: held (`held`), dropped (`dropped`), thrown (`thrown` — snowballs, arrows, rockets)
- **Entities**: players, mobs, NPCs (`lifeform`) — **including armour and cosmetics**

Terrain (full blocks) and Liquid (water) never enter this program.

### What reads differently

Model faces carry three things terrain faces never have:

| Information | Field | Value on terrain |
|---|---|---|
| model-local coordinates | `localPosition: vec3f` | `vec3f(0.0)` (no model) |
| enchant state | `enchantTier` / `enchantColour` / `enchantSpeed` | all 0 |
| entity overlay | `overlayColour` | 0 |

And **textures mean something different**: terrain faces carry atlas `textureId`s, but **most models use `textureId: 0`** ("no texture") — player skins and mob textures are not in the atlas namespace. `surface.colour` already contains skin × tint, so work from it ([model-owned textures](../api/texture-api.md#model-owned-textures-textureid-0)).

`flags`'s `held` / `dropped` / `thrown` / `lifeform` / `placed` are meaningful only on model faces ([Flags](../api/flags.md)).

### localPosition

The model-instance-local position **before** world placement; `vec3f(0.0)` for terrain/liquid.

- For a player's arm, a held sword or windmill blades it rotates with the model
- **Keyed per-part animation and bending effects** become a one-field write — "how far up the blade am I" is directly `localPosition.y`
- In light structs it is the **post-vertex-hook** value (header: *"the same as in BloxdVertexIn, after the vertex hook"*)

### Selection patterns

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.flags.lifeform && !surface.flags.held) {
        out.colour *= 1.05;   // lift world entities, exclude the hand
    }
    if (surface.flags.held) {
        out.colour *= 1.15;   // brighten the local player's held items
    }
    return out;
}
```

Full examples: [model shader recipes](../recipes/model-shaders.md) and [enchant effects](../recipes/enchant-effects.md).

### Terrain / Liquid / Model cheat sheet

| Want to affect | Hooks | Selection fields |
|---|---|---|
| full-block look | `bloxdTerrain*` | material flags (`opaque` / `rock`…) |
| water | `bloxdLiquid*` | always Liquid (no Liquid hooks = water untouched) |
| plants, slabs, stairs | `bloxdModel*` | `flags.flat` / `slab` / `stairs` |
| held items | `bloxdModel*` | `flags.held` |
| dropped items | `bloxdModel*` | `flags.dropped` |
| thrown items | `bloxdModel*` | `flags.thrown` |
| players & mobs | `bloxdModel*` | `flags.lifeform` |

### Lighting

`bloxdModelLight` takes the same `BloxdSurface` / `BloxdLightIn` and works with `bloxdDefaultLight` / `bloxdLitColour()`. The enchant glint (`enchantColour`) and hurt flash (`overlayColour`) mix inside `bloxdLitColour`, so **defaults preserve both looks automatically**; to control them see [enchant effects](../recipes/enchant-effects.md).

### Internals

How models render and how flags/enchant inputs flow: [Engine Internals: Model Rendering](../internals/model-rendering.md); generated symbols like `bloxdSpItemLocalPosition` and `bloxdSpEnchant` are listed in [restrictions](../api/restrictions.md).

## Zwei Umsetzungs-Schulen



**Schule A: additive Fixes (ab defaultLight)** — `engineColour` (fertige Farbe) als Basis nutzen und warmen Glow oder Rim addieren. Leicht und sicher, aber das Lichtmodell bleibt Standard.

**Schule B: totales Relighting (ab s.colour)** — `l.engineColour` verwerfen und Licht aus `s.colour` (Albedo) und rohen LightIn-Materialien neu aufbauen. Der Königsweg zum Realismus. Vier Regeln:

1. **Fog neu anwenden**: Der Light-Hook läuft post-Fog; `mix(l.fogColour, col, (1.0 - l.fogAlpha))` selbst anwenden (R9.10). Bei dichtem Fog mit `min(l.fogAlpha, 0.70)` einen Floor legen. Umgekehrt: mehr Fog-Farbe in engineColour-basierte Pakete zu mischen ergibt weißen Doppel-Fog
2. **Unlit-Fallback**: außerhalb `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` an `defaultLight` durchreichen
3. **Gemeinsame Funktionen als Ganzes schützen**: gemeinsame Funktionen mit `BloxdLightIn`-Parameter als ganze fn in `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` packen (nur Aufrufstellen reicht nicht)
4. **Ohne Sonnenrichtung**: Ist `bloxdSunDirection()` null, kein gerichtetes Specular berechnen. `l.directional` ist ein Lichtmengen-Skalar, kein Richtungsvektor: stellt die Highlight-Richtung nicht wieder her. Bei Bedarf auf schwaches richtungsloses Ambiente wechseln. Die Mondrichtung ist via `-bloxdSunDirection()` verfügbar (bewegt sich nur in Welten mit Tag/Nacht-Zyklus. [Teil VII](../internals/) R-A)

---

## Unerreichbare Looks (die Realismus-„Decke")



| Look | Grund |
|---|---|
| Pixelgenaue Shadowmaps (mit der Sonne rotierende Schatten, Penumbra) | Tiefentexturen nicht referenzierbar (`bloxdOpaqueBehind()`, nur in Flüssigkeiten, liefert nur Geometrieinfo: für Shadowmaps unbrauchbar). Strahlverdeckung kommt nicht in Hooks an |
| SSAO | Kein Szenentiefenzugriff (nur Mesher-gebackene Vertex-AO; Flüssigkeits-Tiefe taugt nicht für SSAO) |
| SSR (Reflexionen) | Keine Szenenfarbe. Nur Pseudo-Looks per Fresnel-Himmelsfarbe |
| Bloom / Glare | Kein Hook ins Post-Processing |
| Tiefenschärfe, chromatische Aberration, Grain | Vollbild-Post-Processing nötig |
| Volumetrisches Licht (God Rays) | Ebenso |
| PBR-Texturen | Textur-Reads verboten. Nur Pseudo-Schätzung aus Farbluminanz |
| Unterwasser-Refraktion | Keine Szenenfarbe. Aber Flüssigkeits-Tiefe (`bloxdOpaqueBehind()`) ermöglicht Dickenabsorption und Grundprojektion ([Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) R-E) |
| Unterwasser-Schleier (blaue Tönung) entfernen/ändern | Der Schleier ist ein emissives Fullscreen-Quad aus Definitionsfarbe/-alpha des Flüssigkeitsblocks der Kamera, außerhalb der Hook-Pipelines (ganz vorne) gezeichnet: Das Paket kann weder Farbe noch Dichte ändern |
| Direkte Unterwasser-Erkennung | Kein Feld zeigt Kamera-Untertauchen; fogStart / fogEnd / fogColour ändern sich unter Wasser nicht: Auch aus fogVisibility etc. gibt es keine verlässliche Schätzung |

### Die Wahrheit über Schatten — „Baumschatten" gehen

Nur **mit der Sonne rotierende pixelgenaue Shadowmaps** sind in der Tabelle unmöglich. Die Engine berechnet „Schatten" von Anfang an, und das ist `skyLight`. Die mesh-seitige LightEngine läuft mit Minecraft-artigem Algorithmus:

1. **Spalten-Scan**: jede (x,z)-Spalte von oben nach unten durchgehen. Himmelslicht startet bei 15, wird an opaken Blöcken **0** und dimmt beim Absteigen mit `lightFilter` (Luft 1 / Wasser 3 / opak 15)
2. **BFS-Flutfüllung**: seitlich zu 6 Nachbarn expandieren (-1 pro Block) — das weicht Schattenkanten auf. Rohwert unter Radius-r-Verdeckung ist (15-r)/15
3. blockLight (Fackeln etc.) ist separates BFS aus 3 RGB-Kanälen (4bit-gepackt)

`l.skyLight` ist also kein bloßer Helligkeitsparameter, sondern **Voxel-Verdeckungsdaten für „ist von hier Himmel sichtbar" = eine Schattenkarte**. Unterm Baum, unterm Dach und innen ist sie bereits numerisch niedrig und kommt per Vertex-Interpolation geglättet an. Blöcke zu setzen/brechen rechnet sofort neu = **in Echtzeit folgende Schatten**. Vanilla nutzt sie nur „sanft" via `mix(Ambiente, Himmel, skyLight)`.

Die richtigen Werkzeuge sind R9.12s zwei Schritte (**Rohwerte per Lift-Inversion wiederherstellen → per Schwellen-`smoothstep` binarisieren**. `th = 1 - r/15` wählt direkt den „als Schatten zählenden Verdeckungsradius") plus **direkte Sonne per Sky gaten** (Sonne erreicht nur sichtbaren Himmel = Essenz der Projektion), mit warmer Sonne- / kalter Schatten-Tönung.

**Ehrliche Limits**: Diese Schatten basieren auf „Himmel nach oben" und **rotieren daher nicht mit der Sonne**. Auflösung ist pro Block (weiche Kanten kommen aus der BFS-Streuung). Das Licht-Template enthält noch einen geschlossenen `var shadow: f32 = 1.;`-Stub für Shadowmaps (immer 1.0 = deaktiviert) — als Spur „geplanter" pixelgenauer Rotationsschatten gedeutet. Sind diese unbedingt nötig, bleiben nur API-ferne Wege (z. B. GLSL-Injektion per Userscript, mit Policy-Risiko).

### Unterwasser-Realität

Unterwasser-Looks bestehen aus 3 Schichten:

| Schicht | Inhalt | Aus Paketen operierbar? |
|---|---|---|
| ① Terrain-/Flüssigkeits-Rendering | Per Hooks verarbeitbar. Light-Hooks laufen unter Wasser normal | Ja (wirkt „unterm Schleier") |
| ② Flüssigkeitsdefinitions-Schleier | Emissives Fullscreen-Quad aus Definitionsfarbe/-alpha des Flüssigkeitsblocks der Kamera, ganz vorne gezeichnet. Die Spieleinstellung `cameraTint` gewinnt, falls gesetzt | Nein (weder Farbe noch Dichte änderbar) |
| ③ cameraTint | Spieleinstellung | Nein |

Praktische Punkte: Pakete wirken auch unter Wasser weiter / der Schleier ist nicht entfernbar / unter Wasser ist keine Verzweigung möglich (fogStart / fogEnd / fogColour ändern sich unter Wasser nicht: fogVisibility erkennt es auch nicht).

## Performance-aware implementation

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Verified (measurement-based practice)

Pack hooks run on every fragment (all pixels of terrain / liquid / model), so style choices move frame rate significantly.

### First facts

- **The light hook is the final stage**: it runs for every drawn pixel of terrain, liquid and model — most of the screen
- **Packs run on WebGPU**: evaluate cost assuming a range of GPUs including mobile
- The loader's size cap (256 KB of `.wgsl`) is also a practical **compile-time** ceiling

### Cost ladder (cheap → expensive)

| Operation | Cost | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `mix` / `clamp` / arithmetic | ◎ minimal | |
| input reads (`l.skyLight`…) | ◎ | uniform/vertex-attribute sourced |
| `smoothstep` / `pow` | ○ | `pow` varies by exponent |
| `sin` / `cos` | ○ | animation staple |
| `dot` / `normalize` | ○ | |
| `bloxdTexel()` (texture sample) | △ | cheaper at higher mips |
| `dpdx` / `dpdy` / `fwidth` | △ | surface/light hooks only |
| branching (`if`) | △ | WGSL may evaluate both sides; uniform-ish conditions (flag checks) are cheap |
| hash noise (many `sin`/`fract`) | △ | gate micro-bump effects by distance |

### Practice

1. **Gate effects to the faces that need them** — `flags` selection beats "+20% everywhere"
2. **Drop detail with distance** — early-out when `distance(surface.position, bloxdEyePosition())` exceeds a threshold
3. **Use mips** — `bloxdTexel(id, uv, mipLevel + 1.0)` is a ¼-resolution average ([worked examples](../api/texture-api.md#worked-examples))
4. **Prefer surface hooks for color tweaks** — the light hook is the all-pixels final stage
5. **Add detail incrementally and compare FPS** ([testing](testing.md))
6. **`#ifdef` guards don't save runtime** — variants are compile units; runtime savings come from flags and distance

### Measuring

- Compare FPS with/without the pack via browser devtools (performance panel / WebGPU stats)
- Measure terrain-heavy scenes (shadow-rich forest) and water (liquid hooks) separately
- Check mobile hardware — it can be tens of times slower

## In-Game-Testcheckliste



Kompiliererfolg und „gutes Aussehen" sind verschiedene Dinge. In dieser Reihenfolge prüfen:

1. **Laden:** `pack.json` im ZIP-Root. Direkt nach der Auswahl erscheint `Ready. Reload the page to use it.` und das Paket wird **beim Neuladen der Seite** aktiv; danach `Ready to use` bestätigen. Gespeicherte Pakete werden beim nächsten Seitenladen automatisch revalidiert: Wann immer sich der engine-seitige Spec-Header aktualisiert, wird der Header-Inhalt per Fingerprint geprüft (bestanden = bleibt unverändert aktiv / fehlgeschlagen = wird als blockiert angezeigt) — ein defektes altes Paket bleibt also nie still aktiv.
2. **6 Varianten:** keine Typ-Guard-Lücken in strict / allow, Licht an / aus, Terrain / Flüssigkeit. Auch wenn ein Spiel nur manche Bedingungen nutzt, sollten Vertriebspakete alle 8 annehmen.
3. **Tag:** Farben pro Material nicht ausgebrannt (Gras, Stein, Sand, Holz); natürlicher Hell/Dunkel-Sprung zwischen Oben und Seiten.
4. **Nacht:** dieselben Materialien im einstigen Tageslicht, Schatten und Fackelnähe vergleichen. Bleiben nur beleuchtete Flächen, Belichtungsdämpfung tunen; wird alles dunkel, lokalen Lichtschutz tunen.
5. **Wasser:** von oben, streifende Winkel, Ufer, unter Wasser und nachts getrennt ansehen. Alpha-Verhalten und Unterwasser-Look hängen vom Spiel-Compositing ab — nie von einem Blickwinkel urteilen. Unter Wasser deckt der Flüssigkeitsdefinitions-Schleier vorne ab, wie in [Teil VII](../internals/) beschrieben: Paket-Unterschiede zeigen sich vor allem an Oberfläche und Terrain hinterm Schleier.
6. **Ränder und Ferne:** keine Wellen-/Mustersprünge an Chunk-/Ursprungsübergängen; kein Doppel-Fog und kein weißer Dunst in der Ferne.
7. **Performance:** fragment-schwere Hash/Trig/`pow`-Effekte minimal. Details schrittweise dazugeben und FPS vergleichen.

### Bekannte Einschränkungen als Prämissen

- Pakete beschränken sich auf Terrain-/Flüssigkeits-Hooks — kein Himmel, keine Entities, keine UI mit demselben Code.
- Keine Inputs, um Shadowmaps, Screen-Space-Reflexionen, Refraktion, Bloom etc. hinzuzufügen (Szenentiefe ist in Flüssigkeiten via `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` freigegeben. Siehe [Teil VIII](../history/v2.md)).
- `bloxdSeconds()` ist Animationszeit ohne garantierte Bindung an Tag/Nacht im Spiel.
- Bei `bloxdSunDirection()`-null ist die wahre Mondrichtung unbekannt, keine „Mondlichtphysik" sondern Stimmungsnäherung. Gerichtetes Mondlicht baut man aus `-bloxdSunDirection()` (nur Welten mit Tag/Nacht-Zyklus. [Teil VII](../internals/) R-A).
- `s.position` / `l.position` sind lokale Koordinaten: `bloxdRenderOffset()` für weltabhängige Effekte addieren. Für blocklokale Muster sind lokale Koordinaten bewusst das Werkzeug.

---

## Mit anderen Paketen kombinieren, wenn der Shader allein ans Limit stößt



Da Pakete keine Texturen hinzufügen oder sampeln können, keine feinen Material-Bumps oder Himmelsbilder per Shader allein lösen wollen. Das öffentliche Texturpaket-Repo für Bloxd.io [Bloxdy/texture-packs](https://github.com/Bloxdy/texture-packs) behandelt Texturen, Skybox, Modelle etc. auf anderem Weg.

Als Referenz entpuppten sich in einem Fall analysierte Community-„Cinematic-Shader"-Distributionen als Texturpakete (128x128-Texturen ohne `pack.json` / `.wgsl`).

In der Praxis **Licht und Farbe per Shader tunen und Materialien plus Himmel per passendem Ressourcenpaket abdecken**. Aber Co-Nutzung und Ladereihenfolge gegen Spiel-Implementierung und -Einstellungen prüfen.

Texturpakete haben ihre eigene Spezifikation (als Referenz): Das Größenlimit liegt bei 25MB, gemessen als Länge des base64-kodierten JSON-Strings; Base64-Kodierung eines PNG bläht es um +33% auf, das praktische Limit für Rohbilder liegt also bei ~18–19MB. CSS wird von einem einfachen Regex-Parser verarbeitet — Verschachtelung und Kommentare vermeiden.

## Debugging-Tipps



- Zu helle Höhlen → nichtlineare `skyLight`-Kurve fehlt (Höhlenrezept R2 / R9.9)
- Ausgebrannte Tage → Pre-ACES-Belichtung senken
- Zu dunkle Nächte → Mindest-Ambiente sichern (Nacht-`skyLightColour` ist prämissenhaft fast schwarz)
- Zu dunstige Ferne → Luftkoeffizienten senken
- Alles orange um Fackeln → Warmanteil senken (etwas rohes getöntes Licht behalten)
- Blöcke fast durchweg weiß → Light-Hook-Output-Summe über 1.0 (downstream kein Clamp). Mit `clamp(col, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0))` enden
- Weiß ohne Additionen → Un-Fog-Inversion per fogVisibility-Division. Un-Fog raus; ab `s.colour` neu aufbauen und Fog einmal am Ende per `mix`
- Emissions-Blöcke leuchten nicht → fehlende Emissions-Re-Addition in Rebuild-Rezepten. `+ s.emission * (1.0 - l.fogAlpha)` dazugeben
- Nachts bleiben nur beleuchtete Flächen → nicht nur Schatten abdunkeln; die ganze fertige Farbe (`engineColour`) nachts dämpfen. Lokale Lampen per `blockLight` / `heldLight` weniger dämpfen ([Teil VI](../guides/), Abschnitt 19)
- Schatten vertiefen sich mit `pow(skyLight, γ)` nicht → `l.skyLight` ist post-Kurve (Abschnitt 10). Auf R9.12-Inversion + Schwelle wechseln
- Schattenfläche/-dichte tunen → R9.12-Tuning-Guide (Fläche = Schwelle `shTh` / Kante = `shSoft` / Kerndunkelheit = Zwei-Punkt-Verschiebung aus Mindest-Ambiente und Himmelsstreulicht)

## Farbrezepte (Surface)



### Einzelfarbton (am grundlegendsten)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    out.colour = clamp(out.colour * vec3f(1.05, 1.0, 0.95), vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
    return out;
}
```

### Sättigung boosten / entsättigen

```wgsl
fn pack_saturation(c: vec3f, amount: f32) -> vec3f {
    let luma = dot(c, vec3f(0.299, 0.587, 0.114));
    return clamp(mix(vec3f(luma), c, 1.0 + amount), vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
}
// amount: +0.3 lebendig / -1.0 total monochrom
```

### Farbtemperatur (warm ⇄ kalt)

```wgsl
fn pack_colorTemp(c: vec3f, warmth: f32) -> vec3f {
    // warmth: +1.0 = warm (stark rot), -1.0 = kalt (stark blau)
    let warm = vec3f(1.08, 1.0, 0.90);
    let cool = vec3f(0.92, 1.0, 1.10);
    let tint = mix(cool, warm, warmth * 0.5 + 0.5);
    return clamp(c * tint, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
}
```

### Vintage / Sepia

```wgsl
fn pack_sepia(c: vec3f, amount: f32) -> vec3f {
    let luma = dot(c, vec3f(0.299, 0.587, 0.114));
    let sepia = vec3f(luma) * vec3f(1.12, 0.98, 0.78);
    return clamp(mix(c, sepia, amount), vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
}
```

### Höhengradient (warmes Tiefland)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    let worldY = s.position.y + f32(bloxdRenderOffset().y);
    let low = clamp(1.0 - worldY * 0.02, 0.0, 1.0);        // 1..0 über Höhe 0..50
    out.colour = clamp(mix(out.colour, out.colour * vec3f(1.10, 0.95, 0.80), low * 0.6), vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
    return out;
}
```

### Nach Flächenausrichtung färben (oben = hell, Wände = dunkel)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    let upness = clamp(s.normal.y, 0.0, 1.0);              // Boden 1 / Wand 0 / Decke -1
    let downness = clamp(-s.normal.y, 0.0, 1.0);
    let shade = mix(0.82, 1.02, upness) - downness * 0.12; // Wände und Decken etwas dunkler
    out.colour = clamp(out.colour * shade, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
    return out;
}
```

### Posterisieren (weniger Farben)

```wgsl
fn pack_posterize(c: vec3f, steps: f32) -> vec3f {
    return clamp(floor(c * steps + vec3f(0.5)) / steps, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
}
```

---

## Lichtrezepte (Light)



### Kontrast-S-Kurve

```wgsl
fn pack_scurve(c: vec3f, strength: f32) -> vec3f {
    let c01 = clamp(c, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
    return mix(c01, c01 * c01 * (vec3f(3.0) - 2.0 * c01), strength);
}
```

### Distanz-Dunst (eigener Fog)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let dist = distance(bloxdEyePosition(), l.position);
    // 0..0.35 eigenen Fog von 64 bis 192 Blöcken dazugeben
    let haze = clamp((dist - 64.0) / 128.0, 0.0, 1.0) * 0.35;
    out.colour = mix(out.colour, l.fogColour, haze);
    return out;
}
```

### Nacht (skyLight-Blauverschiebung + Lampenschutz)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    if (bloxdLit()) {
        let sky = clamp(l.skyLight, 0.0, 1.0);
        out.colour = mix(out.colour, out.colour * vec3f(0.55, 0.68, 1.0), sky * 0.55);
        let blockAmt = max(l.blockLight.r, max(l.blockLight.g, l.blockLight.b));
        out.colour += vec3f(1.0, 0.72, 0.38) * blockAmt * 0.30;
}
    return out;
}
```

### Höhlen stockdunkel (skylight-lose Stellen weiter abdunkeln)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    if (bloxdLit()) {
        let sky = clamp(l.skyLight, 0.0, 1.0);
        let underground = 1.0 - sky;
        out.colour *= mix(1.0, 0.35, underground * underground);
}
    return out;
}
```

> `skyLight` kommt post-Lift an (Abschnitt 10): flache Verdeckung (unterm Baum: roh 0,87 → geliftet 0,97) dunkelt mit dieser Methode kaum. Für Höhlen (roh 0) tauglich. Um „Baumschatten" zu schärfen, Lift-Inversion + Schwellenwert aus R9.12 verwenden.

### Blaues Nacht-Ambiente (Pseudo-Look ohne Mondrichtung)

> In dieser API ist `bloxdSunDirection()` null, wenn der Himmel keine Sonne hat. Folgendes ist kein gerichtetes Mondlicht, nur schwaches blaues Ambiente bei dunklem Himmel. Die Mondrichtung selbst ist via `-bloxdSunDirection()` verfügbar (nur Welten mit Tag/Nacht-Zyklus. [Teil VII](../internals/) R-A).

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    if (bloxdLit()) {
        let sunPresent = smoothstep(0.0, 0.5, length(bloxdSunDirection()));
        let night = 1.0 - sunPresent;
        let sky = clamp(l.skyLight, 0.0, 1.0);
        let upward = clamp(l.normal.y, 0.0, 1.0);
        out.colour += vec3f(0.025, 0.04, 0.075) * night * sky * upward;
}
    return out;
}
```

### Abendrot-Wärme (Farbton nach Sonnenhöhe)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let sunLen = length(bloxdSunDirection());
    if (sunLen > 0.5) {
        let sunDir = bloxdSunDirection() / sunLen;
        let lowness = clamp(1.0 - sunDir.y, 0.0, 1.0);   // 1 am Horizont / 0 im Zenit
        let sunset = lowness * lowness;
        out.colour = mix(out.colour, out.colour * vec3f(1.12, 0.88, 0.72), sunset * 0.55);
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Totaler Engine-Output-Ersatz (einfachstes Relighting)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    if (bloxdLit()) {
        // HINWEIS: direkte BloxdLight(...)-Konstruktion verboten; colour ab default umschreiben
        var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
        let sky = clamp(l.skyLight, 0.0, 1.0);
        let block = max(l.blockLight.r, max(l.blockLight.g, l.blockLight.b));
        let level = clamp(sky * 0.7 + block, 0.0, 1.0);
        // engineColour (das Engine-Lichtergebnis) verwerfen und „Basisfarbe × selbst berechnete Helligkeit" einsetzen
        var col = clamp(s.colour, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0)) * level;
        col = mix(l.fogColour, col, (1.0 - l.fogAlpha));   // engineColour verworfen: Fog-Neuanwendung Pflicht
        out.colour = col + s.emission * (1.0 - l.fogAlpha);   // Emission selbst dazugeben (Pflicht)
        return out;
} else {
        return bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
}
}
```

---

## Emissionsrezepte



> `emission` wird nach der Lichtberechnung addiert, aber die Standardverarbeitung **dämpft es mit `fogVisibility`. In völlig vernebelter Ferne verschwindet Emission ebenfalls. Um Glanz in der Ferne zu behalten, nicht auf emission addieren — direkt als `out.colour += ...` im Light-Hook addieren** (engineColour ist bereits gefoggt, also landet Licht in der Ferne auf der Fog-Farbe)

### Pulsierende Lampen (atmende Fackeln)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    if (bloxdLit()) {
        let glow = max(l.blockLight.r, max(l.blockLight.g, l.blockLight.b));
        let pulse = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(bloxdSeconds() * 2.3 + l.position.x * 0.8);
        out.colour += vec3f(1.0, 0.62, 0.25) * glow * 0.25 * (0.6 + 0.4 * pulse);
}
    return out;
}
```

### Leuchterz-Look (helle Materialien strahlen)

```wgsl
// Surface-Seite: je heller (weißer) das Material, desto mehr Emission
fn bloxdTerrainSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    let luma = dot(out.colour, vec3f(0.299, 0.587, 0.114));
    let shine = smoothstep(0.75, 0.9, luma);
    out.emission += out.colour * shine * 0.5;
    return out;
}
```

### Glühwürmchen-Schwarm (treibende Lichtpunkte)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let world = bloxdWorldPosition(l.position);
    // ein paar langsam treibende „Lichtkugeln"; Glühen per inverser Distanz
    let t = bloxdSeconds() * 0.15;
    let p1 = vec3f(sin(t) * 40.0, 20.0 + sin(t * 1.3) * 6.0, cos(t * 0.7) * 40.0);
    let d1 = distance(world, p1);
    let firefly = clamp(1.0 - d1 / 6.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    let flicker = 0.6 + 0.4 * sin(bloxdSeconds() * 9.0 + d1);
    out.colour += vec3f(0.9, 1.0, 0.4) * firefly * firefly * flicker * 0.6;
    return out;
}
```

---

## Koordinatenrezepte (Welt / Block / Sicht)



### Weltkoordinaten

```wgsl
let worldPos = bloxdWorldPosition(s.position);
```

### Blockkoordinaten

```wgsl
let worldBlock = vec3i(floor(bloxdWorldPosition(l.position)));
```

### Schachbrett (pro Block)

```wgsl
let checker = f32((worldBlock.x + worldBlock.z) & 1);   // 0 oder 1
out.colour *= mix(0.96, 1.04, checker);
```

### Block-Pseudozufall (Hash)

```wgsl
fn pack_hash3(b: vec3i) -> f32 {
    var h = u32(b.x) * 747796405u + u32(b.y) * 28997533u + u32(b.z) * 1911520717u;
    h = h ^ (h >> 16u);
    h = h * 2246822519u;
    h = h ^ (h >> 13u);
    return f32(h & 4095u) / 4095.0;   // 0..1
}
// Nutzen: Grasfarbvariation, Steinmarmorierung etc.
out.colour *= mix(0.94, 1.06, pack_hash3(worldBlock));
```

### Sichtvektor und Rim-Light

```wgsl
let viewDir = normalize(bloxdEyePosition() - l.position);
let rim = pow(1.0 - clamp(dot(viewDir, l.normal), 0.0, 1.0), 2.2);
out.colour += vec3f(0.9, 0.95, 1.0) * rim * 0.2;
```

### Sichtwinkel (Fresnel-Hausmittel — für Flüssigkeiten)

```wgsl
let viewDir = normalize(bloxdEyePosition() - s.position);
let facing = clamp(dot(viewDir, s.normal), 0.0, 1.0);   // 1 frontal / 0 streifend
let fresnel = pow(1.0 - facing, 3.0);
```

---

## Zeitrezepte (Animation)



> `bloxdSeconds()` wrappt alle 3600 Sekunden (1 Stunde). Es ist Shader-Laufzeit ohne garantierte Synchronisation mit Tag/Nacht im Spiel. Für sichtbare periodische Animation ok, aber für echte Nachterkennung `bloxdSunDirection()` und Licht-Inputs bevorzugen.

### Tag-Nacht-Zyklus (1 Tag pro Stunde)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let day = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(bloxdSeconds() * 6.2831853 / 3600.0);   // 0..1 Stundenperiode; nicht unbedingt mit Tag/Nacht im Spiel synchron
    out.colour = mix(out.colour * vec3f(0.6, 0.7, 1.0), out.colour, day);
    return out;
}
```

### Wobbeln (überlagerte Sinus)

```wgsl
fn pack_wobble(x: f32, t: f32) -> f32 {
    return sin(x * 0.8 + t * 1.7) * 0.5 + sin(x * 1.9 - t * 1.1) * 0.3 + sin(x * 3.7 + t * 2.3) * 0.2;
}
```

### Wandernde Aurora-Bänder / Fluoreszenzstreifen

```wgsl
// 3 Farben über XZ-Position und Zeit mischen
fn pack_auroraColour(x: f32, t: f32) -> vec3f {
    let phase = x * 0.05 + t * 0.05;
    let w1 = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(phase);
    let w2 = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(phase * 1.7 + 2.1);
    let w3 = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(phase * 0.6 + 4.2);
    return (vec3f(0.2, 0.9, 0.55) * w1 + vec3f(0.55, 0.3, 0.95) * w2 + vec3f(0.95, 0.35, 0.75) * w3) / (w1 + w2 + w3 + 0.001);
}
```

---

## Flüssigkeitsrezepte



### Gekräuselte Oberfläche (Farbschimmer)

```wgsl
fn bloxdLiquidSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    let worldX = s.position.x + f32(bloxdRenderOffset().x);
    let worldZ = s.position.z + f32(bloxdRenderOffset().z);
    let ripple = sin(bloxdSeconds() * 2.1 + worldX * 1.3 + worldZ * 0.9);
    out.colour = clamp(out.colour * (1.0 + ripple * 0.06), vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0));
    #ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA
    out.alpha = s.alpha;   // Liquid hat immer BLOXD_ALPHA — Guard aus Gewohnheit
    #endif
    return out;
}
```

### Höhen-Pseudo-Transparenz (kein echter Flachwassertest)

> In v1 waren Szenentiefe und Grundposition nicht abfragbar: echte Wassertiefe ließ sich mit dieser API allein nicht berechnen. In v2 misst `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` — nur in Flüssigkeiten — die Dicke bis zur opaken Fläche dahinter ([Teil VIII](../history/v2.md) R-E). Folgendes ist der alte Pseudo-Effekt ohne das: `s.position.y` ist eine lokale Koordinate und roh verwendet verschiebt sich der Effekt mit dem Chunk-Ursprung. Er variiert alpha nur über Welthöhe — Pseudo-Effekt, kein küsten-/grundbewusstes Flachwasser. `packWaterReferenceY` an die eigene Welthöhe anpassen.

```wgsl
const packWaterReferenceY: f32 = 0.0;
const packWaterHeightSpan: f32 = 8.0;

fn bloxdLiquidSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    let worldY = s.position.y + f32(bloxdRenderOffset().y);
    let heightFactor = clamp((worldY - packWaterReferenceY) / packWaterHeightSpan, 0.0, 1.0);
    #ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA
    // unten dünner, oben näher am Basis-Alpha; Richtung im Spiel prüfen
    out.alpha = mix(0.45, 0.9, heightFactor) * s.alpha;
    #endif
    return out;
}
```

### Unterwassertrübung von innen

```wgsl
fn bloxdLiquidLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let dist = distance(bloxdEyePosition(), l.position);
    let murk = clamp(dist / 40.0, 0.0, 0.5);
    out.colour = mix(out.colour, out.colour * vec3f(0.35, 0.55, 0.9) + vec3f(0.0, 0.02, 0.06), murk);
    return out;

    var out = bloxdDefaultVertex(v);
    let sway = sin(bloxdSeconds() * 1.7 + v.position.x * 0.6 + v.position.z * 0.5);

    out.position.y += sway * 0.05 * sideFactor;
    return out;
}

## Realismus-Rezepte



> Physik-Rezepte zum „Vanilla-Look aus Materialien neu aufbauen". Erst diese Prämissen lesen:
>
> 1. **Der Light-Hook läuft in der letzten Fragment-Stufe**. Seine zurückgegebene Farbe wird unverändert zur Endfarbe. **Fog selbst neu anwenden** (R9.10)  
> 2. **Das Engine-Standardlicht ist nur Multiplikation**. Specular / Fresnel / Warm-Kalt-Trennung / Hemisphären-Ambiente werden von null aufgebaut  
> 3. `l.engineColour` ist die fertige Farbe (bereits gefoggt). Neuaufbau aus `s.colour` (Albedo) ist der Königsweg  
> 4. Texturen verboten → alle Details müssen **prozedural** sein (Hash/Rauschen) (R9.8)

fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.flags.lifeform && !surface.flags.held) {
        out.colour *= 1.05;
    }
    if (surface.flags.held) {
        out.colour *= 1.15;
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Glowing blade tips (localPosition)

`localPosition` rotates with the model — "where on the model am I" without world-space guesswork:

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.flags.held) {
        let tipness = clamp(surface.localPosition.y * 0.5 + 0.5, 0.0, 1.0);
        out.emission += vec3f(0.3, 0.4, 0.6) * tipness * tipness * 0.6;
    }
    return out;
}
```

Note: actual `localPosition` ranges vary per model — verify on-device and `clamp` defensively.

### Highlighting dropped items

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.flags.dropped) {
        let pulse = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(bloxdSeconds() * 2.0
            + surface.localPosition.x * 3.0);
        out.emission += vec3f(0.08, 0.10, 0.06) * pulse;
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Cool rim on player skins (lifeform)

Most models use `textureId: 0` (skins); `surface.colour` already has skin × tint:

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light);
    if (light.flags.lifeform) {
        let viewDir = normalize(bloxdEyePosition() - light.position);
        let rim = pow(1.0 - clamp(dot(viewDir, normalize(light.normal)), 0.0, 1.0), 2.5);
        out.colour += vec3f(0.4, 0.5, 0.7) * rim * 0.25;
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Swaying plants in the wind (allow only)

Plants (`flags.flat`) are drawn as models — sway via the vertex hook:

```wgsl
#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT
fn bloxdModelVertex(vertex: BloxdVertexIn) -> BloxdVertex {
    var out = bloxdDefaultVertex(vertex);
    if (vertex.flags.flat) {
        let sway = sin(bloxdSeconds() * 1.8
            + bloxdWorldPosition(vertex.position).x * 0.7);
        let tipness = clamp(vertex.localPosition.y + 0.5, 0.0, 1.0);
        out.position.x += sway * 0.08 * tipness;
    }
    return out;
}
#endif
```

(Vegetation is also `flags.vegetation`: `flat` = "drawn as a crossed plane", `vegetation` = "is a plant" — grass and flowers are both.)

### Atlas-textured model faces only

Block-model faces (slabs, stairs…) carry atlas `textureId`s; select with `textureId != 0u`:

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.textureId != 0u) {
        let t = bloxdTexel(surface.textureId, fract(surface.uv), surface.mipLevel);
        out.colour = mix(out.colour, t.rgb, 0.2);
    }
    return out;
}
```

`textureId: 0` faces (skins) sample as white — no error ([model-owned textures](../api/texture-api.md#model-owned-textures-textureid-0)).

### Armour vs the rest

`flags.lifeform` includes armour and cosmetics ([Flags](../api/flags.md)). No finer-grained input exists; combine `localPosition` (placement) or `overlayColour` presence as practical approximations.

### Sharing with terrain

Uniform grading across full blocks and block models:

```wgsl
fn applyGrade(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    out.colour *= vec3f(1.02, 1.0, 0.98);
    return out;
}

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return applyGrade(surface);
}

fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    return applyGrade(surface);
}
```

The shared-function pattern is what the default pack template itself recommends ([hooks](../getting-started/hooks.md#fallbacks-and-code-sharing)).

## Enchant effects

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Analyzed (restored from the live header)

v5 opened the enchant pipeline on both inputs and outputs. Recipes for controlling the glint of enchanted items and armour while preserving the engine's math.

### Inputs & outputs

**Inputs** (`BloxdSurfaceIn` / `BloxdLightIn` — enchanted items and armour only, all 0 otherwise):

```wgsl
enchantTier: u32,     // 1-5 for Tier 1-5.
enchantColour: vec4f, // RGB enchant colour, and its animated alpha.
enchantSpeed: f32,    // How fast the pattern moves, faster at higher tiers.
```

**Output** (`BloxdSurface`):

```wgsl
enchantColour: vec4f, // Enchant output, mixed in by bloxdLitColour.
```

The engine mixes it inside [`bloxdLitColour()`](../api/lighting.md) — right after shading, before world light. `bloxdDefaultSurface` passes the input through unchanged, so **the default look matches v4's engine-internal behavior**.

### Understanding the defaults

Input `enchantColour.a` is an **animated** alpha — the engine animates the glint sweep, so reading `.a` per fragment yields a moving pattern for free. `enchantTier` and `enchantSpeed` are consistent by construction («faster at higher tiers»).

Unenchanted faces carry `enchantTier == 0`, `enchantColour == vec4f(0.0)`, `enchantSpeed == 0.0`.

### Recipe 1: no-glint realism (two lines)

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    out.enchantColour = vec4f(0.0);
    return out;
}
```

### Recipe 2: stronger glint by tier

`enchantTier` gives the classic "tier-scaled glint" without parsing colors:

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.enchantTier > 0u) {
        let tierBoost = 1.0 + f32(surface.enchantTier) * 0.12;
        out.enchantColour.a = clamp(surface.enchantColour.a * tierBoost, 0.0, 1.0);
        out.enchantColour.rgb = surface.enchantColour.rgb;
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Recipe 3: recoloring the glint

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.enchantTier > 0u) {
        var e = surface.enchantColour;
        e.rgb = mix(vec3f(0.35, 0.8, 1.0), vec3f(0.9, 0.5, 1.0),
                    f32(surface.enchantTier) / 5.0);   // low tiers blue, high purple
        out.enchantColour = e;
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Recipe 4: enchantSpeed-driven sweep

Turn `enchantSpeed` into a phase for a custom sweep:

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    if (surface.enchantTier > 0u) {
        let band = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(surface.localPosition.y * 6.0
                                   - bloxdSeconds() * surface.enchantSpeed * 2.0);
        var e = surface.enchantColour;
        e.a = clamp(e.a * (0.4 + 0.6 * band), 0.0, 1.0);
        out.enchantColour = e;
    }
    return out;
}
```

### Recipe 5: amplifying the hurt flash (overlayColour)

`overlayColour` (players/mobs only; hurt flash etc.) mixes before lighting in `bloxdLitColour`:

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelSurface(surface: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(surface);
    out.overlayColour.a = clamp(surface.overlayColour.a * 1.6, 0.0, 1.0);
    return out;
}
```

Harmless on non-entities (`overlayColour` is 0 there).

### Combining with custom lighting

Using `bloxdLitColour()` keeps the enchant/overlay mixing automatic:

```wgsl
fn bloxdModelLight(surface: BloxdSurface, light: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    if (!bloxdLit()) { return bloxdDefaultLight(surface, light); }
    let lit = bloxdLitColour(surface, light);
    return BloxdLight(bloxdApplyFog(lit + surface.emission, light));
}
```

### Notes

- Enchant inputs arrive **only on enchanted items and armour** — all 0 on terrain, water and unenchanted faces
- Changing the `enchantColour` output never touches `colour` directly — mixing happens in `bloxdLitColour` / `bloxdDefaultLight`
- Outside the model pipeline the enchant inputs are always 0

## Pipeline-Details



- **Surface-Hooks laufen „vor" alphaTest**: `out.alpha` speist den Verwerfungstest direkt. Cutout-Materialien (Gras, Blätter) erlauben Dissolve-Dither-Effekte (Rezept R-C). In Flüssigkeiten (Blending) ist `out.alpha` die echte Transparenz (Rezept R-D). Kein Effekt auf normalem opakem Terrain — nicht verwechseln
- **`l.ambient`-Inhalt**: `material.ambient × sceneAmbient`, pro Material verschieden. Die Szenenseite hängt an der Grafik-Einstellung „Ambient Lighting Intensity" (Standard 0.5) — nie Fixes einprogrammieren
- **Die Richtlichter der Szene sind ein 2-Lampen-Aufbau**: Die Lambert-Summe aus Hauptlicht (Richtung aus der Sonnenposition der Sky-Einstellung, Intensität 1.0) und Fülllicht (Richtung `[-0.5, -1, -1]`, Intensität 0.35) erreicht `l.directional`. Das Fülllicht zeigt nach unten, trägt also nichts zu Oberseiten bei und fängt nach unten weisende Flächen ein (Höhlendecken usw.). Terrain berücksichtigt nur in `_initScene` hinzugefügte Lichter; nach dem Start zur Szene hinzugefügte Lichter werden von Terrain und Blockmodellen ignoriert (eine offizielle Warnmeldung sagt das)
- **`bloxdSeconds()` ist wirklich `performance.now()`**: die Browser-Uptime, auf 1 Stunde gewrappt. Ohne Bezug zu Spiel-Tag/Nacht und Welt-Laufzeit. Für uhr-synchrone Animation die Uhrzeit aus dem `bloxdSunDirection()`-Azimut in Tag/Nacht-Zyklus-Welten schätzen
- **Header-Funktionen lesen ein Uniform**: Die Engine platziert ein 64-Byte-Uniform auf `@group(3) @binding(0)` (4 Slots — Zeit / originOffset / sunDirection / eyePosition, Little-Endian), und `bloxdSeconds()` / `bloxdRenderOffset()` / `bloxdSunDirection()` / `bloxdEyePosition()` entsprechen dem Lesen dieser Slots. `originOffset` ist im aktuellen Build immer `[0, 0, 0]` (ein reservierter Slot für Fließkomma-Weltkoordinaten). Pakete können dieses Uniform nicht schreiben, und da Paket- und Engine-WGSL zu einem Modul verschmelzen, ist auch das eigene Deklarieren derselben group/binding unmöglich. (v3 benennt die beiden Slots um — `seconds` / `renderOffset`, exponiert als `bloxdSeconds()` / `bloxdRenderOffset()` — und ergänzt die Szenentiefe-Textur bei `@group(3) @binding(1)`; siehe [Teil IX](../history/v3.md) §41 und §51.)
- **Vertex-Daten baut der Mesher (Web Worker)**: Block-Terrain ist mit 28 Byte pro Vertex verschachtelt (32 Byte mit Atlas) — Position = float32×3 / Normale = vorzeichenbehaftete 8-Bit-Ganzzahl×4 / Farbe = 8-Bit-normalisierte Ganzzahl×4 (die Substanz von `s.colour` — Tint × AO ist schon im Mesher in 8 Bit eingebacken, ein Auftrennen oder Wiederherstellen im Paket ist prinzipiell unmöglich) / UV = float32×2 / atlasIndex = float32. Nur die Lichtlevel liegen in einem separaten 4-Byte-Vertex-Buffer ([Teil VII](../internals/) §26, [Teil II](../api/) §11). Vertices werden per Chunk-Instancing gezeichnet
- Feine Schachbrettmuster an Chunk-Rändern beim Laden sind das Chunk-Fading per Screen-Space-Bayer-4×4-Dither der Engine, keine Paket-Bugs (abschaltbar über die Grafik-Einstellung `chunkFadeIn`)
- **`mod` ist ein reserviertes Wort**: abgelehnt mit `pack.wgsl:3 'mod' is a reserved word in WGSL.` Reste mit `%`-Operator schreiben

### R-C. Bayer-Dither-Dissolve — out.alpha steuert discard

Reproduziert die **gleiche Bayer-4×4-Tabelle**, die die Engine in Chunk-Fades nutzt, und löst Cutouts von unteren Blöcken auf. discard feuert in alphaTest-Materialien (Gras, Blätter); in Flüssigkeiten ist es Misch-Transparenz.

```wgsl
fn sp_bayer4(pos: vec2f) -> f32 {
    // mod ist reserviert: %-Operator verwenden
    let p = floor(vec2f(pos.x % 4.0, pos.y % 4.0));
    if (p.y < 0.5) {
        if (p.x < 0.5) { return 1.0 / 16.0; }
        else if (p.x < 1.5) { return 9.0 / 16.0; }
        else if (p.x < 2.5) { return 3.0 / 16.0; }
        else { return 11.0 / 16.0; }
    } else if (p.y < 1.5) {
        if (p.x < 0.5) { return 13.0 / 16.0; }
        else if (p.x < 1.5) { return 5.0 / 16.0; }
        else if (p.x < 2.5) { return 15.0 / 16.0; }
        else { return 7.0 / 16.0; }
    } else if (p.y < 2.5) {
        if (p.x < 0.5) { return 4.0 / 16.0; }
        else if (p.x < 1.5) { return 12.0 / 16.0; }
        else if (p.x < 2.5) { return 2.0 / 16.0; }
        else { return 10.0 / 16.0; }
    } else {
        if (p.x < 0.5) { return 16.0 / 16.0; }
        else if (p.x < 1.5) { return 8.0 / 16.0; }
        else if (p.x < 2.5) { return 14.0 / 16.0; }
        else { return 6.0 / 16.0; }
    }
}

fn bloxdTerrainSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    #ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA
    // löst von unteren Blöcken auf; höheres dissolve bleibt
    let dissolve = smoothstep(-8.0, 24.0, s.position.y + vec3f(bloxdRenderOffset()).y);
    let thresh   = sp_bayer4(s.position.xz);
    out.alpha    = select(0.0, out.alpha, dissolve >= thresh);
    #endif
    return out;
}
```

### R-D. Wasser-Nahkamera-Fade — Flüssigkeits-Alpha hält Sicht frei

Flüssigkeits-Hook-`out.alpha` speist das Blending direkt. Blendet nur die Fläche unter der Kamera aus, um Tauch-/Überwasser-Kamera-Sicht zu sichern.

```wgsl
fn bloxdLiquidSurface(s: BloxdSurfaceIn) -> BloxdSurface {
    var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);
    #ifdef BLOXD_ALPHA
    let d = distance(s.position, bloxdEyePosition());
    out.alpha *= smoothstep(0.0, 3.0, d);   // 0–3 Blöcke von total transparent bis normal
    #endif
    return out;
}
```

## Hook invocation internals

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored from the production bundle — the Lite renderer; the integrated source file `lite/terrainShaderPack.ts` survives in error strings)

How the engine calls hooks at runtime. This changes nothing about the code you write, but removes the guesswork about what hooks receive.

### The splice architecture

The renderer does not "call" hooks from JavaScript. Once a pack passes validation, the engine **grafts your hook invocations into its terrain WGSL by replacing fixed anchor lines in the shader text**. Each anchor must match exactly once — zero or multiple matches abort with `at the shader pack ${hook} hook: ${no|more than one} anchor (lite/terrainShaderPack.ts)`.

| Stage | Anchor in the engine shader | What is grafted |
|---|---|---|
| vertex | the `let worldPos = …` through `vertexOutputs.vNormalW = …` block | build `BloxdVertexIn`, call the vertex hook, write `worldPos` back (also rewriting `let worldPos` to `var worldPos`) |
| surface | `baseColor = vec4f(baseColor.rgb * fragmentInputs.vColor, baseColor.a);` | build `BloxdSurfaceIn`, call the surface hook, write `baseColor` / `alpha` back |
| lit color | just before the fog mix | captures the pre-fog color (v3 used the `bloxdSpLitColour` temporary — v5 promotes this role into the public `bloxdLitColour()` header function) |
| light | the `return color;` at the fragment shader's end | build `BloxdLightIn`, call the light hook, write `color` back — after the fog mix |

### What the splice forces

- **strict terrain ignores surface-hook alpha changes.** The `alpha = bloxdSpSurface.alpha` write-back is grafted only for the liquid program or non-strict variants — the implementation behind the macro table ([Preprocessor](../api/preprocessor.md))
- **A strict variant that declares a vertex hook never runs it.** The engine reports at build time: `Shader pack code ${variant} is strict and has a vertex hook, which strict mode never runs`. Hence the template's `#ifndef BLOXD_STRICT`
- **`bloxdSp*` identifiers** are engine temporaries — invisible to your code but present in diagnostics and reverse-engineering output ([Reserved identifiers](reserved-identifiers.md) — 46 in v5)
- **The default-surface shortcut.** If a variant's surface hook is literally `bloxdDefaultSurface`, the engine omits the `baseColor` / `alpha` write-back graft entirely — the default already produces those values, so the assignments are dead code. **Unmodified hook chains cost nothing**

### What changed in v5

The splice architecture existed in the v2 renderer and stayed stable across v2 → v3 (v3 only changed `vBlockId` → `vBlockFlags` and added the liquid variant). v5's changes:

- `vBlockFlags` (bits) → the **`BloxdFlags` struct** (delivered via `bloxdSpFlags`)
- the `litColour` capture went from engine-internal to **public API** (`bloxdLitColour()` — v4's `bloxdSpLitColour` promoted)
- `BloxdLightIn` gained `diffuse` / `emissive`, and `bloxdShading()` rebuilds the material response ([Lighting](../api/lighting.md))
- delivery of `localPosition` (`bloxdSpItemLocalPosition`), enchant inputs (`bloxdSpEnchant`) and `overlayColour` ([Model rendering](model-rendering.md))
- `fogVisibility` → **`fogAlpha`** (inverted)
- the Model program joined the variant matrix (3 programs × 2 modes = 6 variants)

### What feeds BloxdLightIn (per field)

| Field | Engine-side source |
|---|---|
| `litColour` | the fragment color captured just before the fog mix — "before emission and fog" in header terms |
| `directional` | the vertex-interpolated sum of per-directional-light Lambert (2-light setup in [Rendering pipeline](rendering-pipeline.md)) |
| `diffuse` / `emissive` | the material's directional RGB response / RGB glow (new in v5) |
| `ambient` | `material.ambient × sceneAmbient` — per material, per frame |
| `blockLight` / `skyLight` | the decoded light-level varyings ([Lighting internals](lighting-internals.md)) |
| `ambientLightColour` / `skyLightColour` | the corresponding uniforms |
| `heldLight` | built from the light-level varying and held-light uniforms (cone falloff in [Lighting internals](lighting-internals.md)) |
| `fogColour` | black only in entirely fog-less scenes (mode 0) |
| `fogAlpha` | the clamped fog factor ([Fog internals](fog-internals.md)) |
| `position` / `normal` / `localPosition` / `flags` / `textureId` / `textureRotation` / `uv` / `mipLevel` | varyings and flat-interpolated values (same as `BloxdSurfaceIn` — post-vertex-hook values) |

## Shader validation internals

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored from the live validator)

The static validation (analyzer, stage 1 of the load check). User-facing fixes: [Validation errors](../troubleshooting/validation.md).

### The stages

1. **Loader limits** (zip / pack.json shape) → [Pack format](../api/pack-format.md)
2. **Static validation (analyzer)** — this page; syntax, types, reserved names, hook contracts across all 6 variants
3. **Real browser compilation** → [WGSL compilation](wgsl-compilation.md)
4. **Runtime re-validation on game join** — actually compiles every existing terrain material (stricter than the settings-screen check); failing it drops the pack for that game

### The special-function signature table

The validator keeps a table in module 29849 and checks cross-hook call restrictions:

```js
const Jq = new Map([
  ["bloxdFragmentBlockPosition", { params: "position: vec3f, normal: vec3f", returns: "vec3i", symbol: null, vertex: true }],
  ["bloxdOpaqueBehind", { params: "", returns: "BloxdOpaqueBehind", symbol: "BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH" }],
  ["bloxdTexel", { params: "textureId: u32, uv: vec2f, mipLevel: f32", returns: "vec4f", symbol: null }],
  ["bloxdTextureSize", { params: "mipLevel: f32", returns: "vec2u", symbol: null }],
]);
```

Restored logic:

- calling a non-`vertex: true` special function from a vertex hook → *"X reaches Y, which only surface and light hooks can use."*
- a function with a `symbol` (`bloxdOpaqueBehind` → `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH`) reached from a variant that doesn't define that macro → *"X reaches Y, which needs BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH, and Z doesn't define it; in code other programs' hooks share, guard the call with #ifdef BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH."*

Note: `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition` is gone from v5's header generation but its old definition remains in this table (observed on the v5 build). Calls are rejected by validation.

### Reserved-name diagnostics

- **the `/^bloxd/i` general rule**: *"Packs can't declare names starting with bloxd, other than the hook functions bloxd<Terrain|Liquid|Model><Vertex|Surface|Light>"*
- **direct texture/sampler declarations**: *"Packs can't use X: the engine binds every texture and sampler. Surface and light hooks can read atlas textures with bloxdTexel."*

### Texture-name resolution & diagnostics

`bloxdTextureId*` resolution has a dedicated path ([the messages](../api/texture-api.md#name-resolution-errors-verbatim-from-the-validator)):

- **folding**: split on non-alphanumerics, CamelCase, prefix with `bloxdTextureId`; reverse matching is case/underscore-insensitive
- **spelling suggestions** (new in v5): unmatched names get Levenshtein proposals at threshold `max(2, floor(len/4)) + 1`
- dedicated messages for frame spellings and turned-copy spellings
- post-fold ambiguous names are unusable

### v5's new diagnostics

- *"BLOXD_LIGHTING was removed in apiVersion 5; test bloxdLit() in code instead."* — names the removed macro
- packs reading `blockFlags` or referencing `bloxdBlockFlag*` fail the reserved-name diagnostic — **no pack misbehaves silently**

### The Y-derivative rewrite

The analyzer's token-rewrite pass rewrites every `dpdy` / `dpdyCoarse` / `dpdyFine` call to `(-dpdy(...))` (the dpdy family is explicitly enumerated as the inversion set). `dpdx` and `fwidth` are untouched ([Restrictions](../api/restrictions.md#auto-rewrite-introduced-in-v5)).

### Header & texture-constant generation

- the header is prepended read-only ([Engine header](engine-header.md))
- the `bloxdTextureId*` block is generated **per pack** from referenced names

### HEADER_VERSION

`HEADER_VERSION` is `9.<fnv1a32(header)>.<fnv1a32(texture registry)>` (leading integer 8 → 9 from v4). The two fnv1a32 suffixes fingerprint the header material and the sorted name-id registry. Saved-pack re-validation uses this fingerprint to decide "needs re-check" ([Compatibility](../api/compatibility.md#saved-pack-re-validation-needs-re-check)).

### Validation stubs

Code that passes static validation gets stub code synthesized before the real browser-WGSL check: `var<private> bloxdValidationP: vec4f` plus `bloxdValidateVertex` / `bloxdValidateFragment` — the type-stub table (`bool` → `p.x > 0.0`, `vec3f` → `p.xyz`, …) builds input structs and invokes the hooks. Details: [WGSL compilation](wgsl-compilation.md).

## WGSL compilation internals

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored from the live bundle)

The second validation stage — real compilation through the browser's WGSL compiler — and v5's validation stubs.

### Why two stages

Static validation's type-checking is incomplete, so some mistakes only surface here (e.g. WGSL operator-precedence requirements like `mixing '*' and '^' requires parenthesis`). Errors surface in-game with the variant name ([Compilation errors](../troubleshooting/compilation.md)).

### Validation-stub generation

The engine synthesizes stubs for code that passed static validation (restored from module 29866):

- the type-stub table:

| Type | Stub value |
|---|---|
| `bool` | `p.x > 0.0` |
| `f32` | `p.x` |
| `vec2f` | `p.xy` |
| `vec3f` | `p.xyz` |
| `vec4f` | `p` |
| `i32` / `vec2i` / `vec3i` / `vec4i` | `i32(p.x)` etc. |
| `u32` / `vec2u` / `vec3u` / `vec4u` | `u32(p.x)` etc. |

- structs build recursively — each field filled with stub values (nested structs recurse)
- the synthesized entry points:

```wgsl
var<private> bloxdValidationP: vec4f;

fn <special fn>(<params>) -> <returns> {
    let p = bloxdValidationP;
    return <stub value>;
}

@vertex
fn bloxdValidateVertex(@builtin(vertex_index) i: u32) -> @builtin(position) vec4f {
    let p = vec4f(f32(i));
    let o = <vertexHook>(BloxdVertexIn(<stubs>));
    return vec4f(o.position, 1.0);
}

@fragment
fn bloxdValidateFragment(@builtin(position) p: vec4f) -> @location(0) vec4f {
    bloxdValidationP = p;
    let s = <surfaceHook or bloxdDefaultSurface>(BloxdSurfaceIn(<stubs>));
    let o = <lightHook or bloxdDefaultLight>(s, BloxdLightIn(<stubs>));
    return vec4f(o.colour, 1.0);
}
```

Validation literally compiles "WGSL that calls your hooks with stub inputs" in the browser, surfacing syntax, type and language-feature violations.

### Error-message name restoration

When splicing hook calls the engine keeps an identifier mapping (`originalNames`). Identifiers in browser errors are mapped **back to your original names**, and `sourceOf(lineNum)` maps spliced line numbers back to (file, line) — you read errors against your own code, not the transformed text.

### Runtime re-validation on join

`checkCompilation` runs per game join and actually compiles every existing terrain material (stricter than the settings-screen check). Failing drops the pack for that game. The check has a 60-second forced timeout ([Performance](../troubleshooting/performance.md)).

## Reserved identifier internals

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored from the live bundle's generators)

The `bloxdSp*` namespace — symbols the generators may inject and packs therefore cannot redeclare. The pack-author summary: [Restrictions](../api/restrictions.md).

### The 46 symbols

Grown from v4's 27 to **46** (20 added, 1 retired — `bloxdSpLitColour`, promoted into the public `bloxdLitColour()`):

`bloxdSpAcross` · `bloxdSpAt` · `bloxdSpBehind` · `bloxdSpCell` · `bloxdSpCellAt` · `bloxdSpCellIndex` · `bloxdSpColour` · `bloxdSpDdx` · `bloxdSpDdy` · `bloxdSpDown` · `bloxdSpEnchant` · `bloxdSpEye` · `bloxdSpFlags` · `bloxdSpFrame` · `bloxdSpIndex` · `bloxdSpInside` · `bloxdSpItemLocalPosition` · `bloxdSpLayer` · `bloxdSpLevel` · `bloxdSpLight` · `bloxdSpLightIn` · `bloxdSpLod` · `bloxdSpMipLevel` · `bloxdSpNormal` · `bloxdSpOut` · `bloxdSpOwnTexel` · `bloxdSpPixel` · `bloxdSpPosition` · `bloxdSpPositionW` · `bloxdSpQuarterTurns` · `bloxdSpScale` · `bloxdSpSceneDepth` · `bloxdSpSize` · `bloxdSpSurface` · `bloxdSpSurfaceIn` · `bloxdSpTexelUV` · `bloxdSpTexture` · `bloxdSpTextureId` · `bloxdSpTextureLayers` · `bloxdSpTextureRotation` · `bloxdSpTurned` · `bloxdSpUv` · `bloxdSpVertex` · `bloxdSpVertexIn` · `bloxdSpWord` · `bloxdSpZ`

### New names ↔ v5 features

- `bloxdSpFlags` — delivery of the `BloxdFlags` struct
- `bloxdSpEnchant` / `bloxdSpItemLocalPosition` — the new inputs (enchant, model-local position)
- `bloxdSpAcross` / `bloxdSpAt` / `bloxdSpCell` / `bloxdSpCellAt` / `bloxdSpCellIndex` / `bloxdSpSize` / `bloxdSpLevel` / `bloxdSpOwnTexel` — the cell-sampling texture-pack path
- `bloxdSpQuarterTurns` — the rotation chain ([Texture sampling](texture-sampling.md))
- `bloxdSpNormal` / `bloxdSpPosition` / `bloxdSpColour` / `bloxdSpOut` / `bloxdSpWord` / `bloxdSpIndex` / `bloxdSpDown` / `bloxdSpInside` — extended-hook locals

### The pack-level rule

Broader than this namespace: **everything matching `/^bloxd/i` (case-insensitive)**. Only the 9 hook function names may be declared ([Validation errors](../troubleshooting/validation.md)).

`bloxdTextureId`-prefixed identifiers resolve as texture names with their dedicated error family ([Texture issues](../troubleshooting/textures.md)).

## blockLight-/heldLight-Interna



`blockLight` ist **farbiges Licht** mit drei RGB-Kanälen. Jeder leuchtende Block definiert eine Emissionsfarbe `[R, G, B]` (je 0–15), die unverändert als Lichtfarbe übernommen wird (normale Fackel = warmweiß (14,14,12) / Lava = orange (14,8,2) / Beacon = cyan (5,14,14) / weiße Fackel = (15,15,15) usw.). In der Vertex-Stufe kommt sie als 4 Nibbles gepackt an — r / g / b / sky — in einem Float-Attribut. Die drei Kanäle im Light-Hook getrennt zu behandeln, ermöglicht farbiges lokales Licht — das warme Fackel-Rezept (R9.1) ist auf dieses Verhalten kalibriert.

Beim Dekodieren von `aPackedLightLevels` legt die Engine pro Kanal einen **Floor von 35 % des hellsten RGB-Kanals**. Z. B. wird „reines Rotlicht" in Vertices auf (1,00, 0,35, 0) gehoben, vor Interpolation und Lift. Dass Fackel-Orange im Spiel „weißlich-pink statt rot" wirkt, kommt hierher — warmes Fackel-Rezept (R9.1)-Sättigung gegen dieses Default tunen.

Die Licht-Komposition ist nicht additiv. Intern nimmt die Engine das **Maximum** aus Blocklicht (nach dem 35-%-Floor) und Sky-Licht in der Form `mix(Umgebungsfarbe, Himmelsfarbe, skyLight)` und davon erneut das Maximum mit Handlicht (nach Ambient-Boost). Die Kanalwerte dieser Komposition sind die **Post-Lift**-Werte — die Engine komponiert aus denselben angehobenen Lichtpegeln, die die Hook-Eingaben erreichen (`terrainLightLevels` nach der Lift-Kurve), in v2 wie in v3. `blockLight` und `skyLight` heben sich also nie gegenseitig auf — der Beitrag der dunkleren Seite wird schlicht verworfen — deshalb dunkelt abgeschwächtes Sky-Licht von blockLight dominierte Stellen kaum ab. Belichtungs- und Abfall-Rezepte um diese Struktur herum bauen (der lokale Lichtschutz in [Teil VI](../guides/) §19 existiert als Ausgleich dafür).

Handlicht (`heldLight`) hat Reichweite nach hellstem Kanal (max 15 Blöcke) mit `dist^0.75`-Vorverarbeitung, demselben 35-%-Floor, und `l.heldLight` ist der **Pre**-Ambient-Boost-Wert. Der Kegelabfall, restauriert aus dem Lichtmodul der Engine: Die Winkelabschwächung des Strahls ist `1 − 0.5 × (smoothstep(0.12, 0.65, t) + smoothstep(0.62, 0.95, t))`, wobei `t` der normierte Winkel von der Kegelachse ist (0 = Zentrum, 1 = Rand); die Reichweite ist `(rangeOverride > 0 ? rangeOverride : hellster Kanal) × Kegelabfall`, wobei `rangeOverride` aus dem Alpha der Handlicht-Farbe gelesen wird; innerhalb der Reichweite dämpft ein Override mit `(range − dist) / range`, während der Standard die (vorverarbeitete) Distanz kanalweise abzieht; danach folgen der 35-%-Floor, Division durch 15, die Lift-Kurve und schließlich der Ambient-Boost. Custom-Items können `spotlightRange` und Kegelwinkel setzen — ein „Strahl im Halten"-Modus, dessen Kegel der Kamera folgt. Pakete können die Strahlrichtung nicht wissen.

Custom-Blöcke können `skyLightEmission` (0–15) tragen, das **in den skyLight-Kanal selbst injiziert, separat zum blockLight-BFS**. R9.12-artige Pakete, die Sonne/Schatten per skyLight-Schwelle beurteilen, können in Welten mit künstlich gehobenem skyLight danebenliegen. Vertriebspakete beurteilen robuster kombiniert mit blockLight.

## Fog-Interna



Die Fog-Berechnung ist immer LINEAR-Modus (`fogVisibility = (fogEnd - dist) / (fogEnd - fogStart)`, clamp 0..1), mit `fogStart = 32 × D`, `fogEnd = 32 × (D + 1)` (D = Fog-Einstellung; nur D = 0 ist speziell mit fogEnd = 5). **Das Gradientenband ist nur 32 Blöcke breit**, und `(1.0 - l.fogAlpha)` ist weniger „Distanzdunst" als **normierte Distanz zur Kante der geladenen Welt**. Variiert pro Spieler mit Ladedistanz: Distanz-Effekte sollten `distance(l.position, bloxdEyePosition())` selbst berechnen (Rezept R-B). (v3-Hinweis: Die Fog-Funktion des Renderers implementiert tatsächlich **vier** Modi — aus / exponentiell / exponentiell zum Quadrat / linear —, wobei ausgelieferte Titel den linearen Modus fahren; der restaurierte Quellcode und das Robustheitsargument stehen in [Teil IX](../history/v3.md) §50.)

Standard-Fog-Farbe `rgb(183, 191, 195)` (blasses Blaugrau). Welt-Ersteller ändern sie via `fogColourOverride` (hex). Bei Fog-Modus 0 (NONE) **kommt fogColour schwarz an**. Die Standardform `mix(l.fogColour, col, (1.0 - l.fogAlpha))` ist sicher, da Fog-Farbe bei fogVisibility 1 ungenutzt bleibt. Die Script-API hat zwei weitere Optionen, `fogChunkDistanceOverride` und `fogOnSkybox`: Custom Games können die Fog-Distanz (den D-Wert) und die Fog-Anwendung auf die Skybox unabhängig setzen. Standardmäßig ist die Skybox nicht vom Fog betroffen (nur in Spielen mit aktivem `fogOnSkybox` wird auch die Skybox mit der Fog-Farbe getönt).

`showFog` auf false zu setzen schiebt Fog auf 3200–3232 Blöcke und deaktiviert faktisch (`fogVisibility ≈ 1` kommt weiter).

### R-B. Ladekanten-Band — fogVisibility als „Weltkante"

Kühlt leise nur das 32-Block-Band der Ladekante, um das Weltende zu kaschieren (oder als Effekt zu betonen). Ohne selbst berechnete Distanz: folgt automatisch den Ladedistanz-Einstellungen des Spielers.

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    // fogVisibility: 1 = innen (Spielraum zur Kante), 0 = kurz vorm Kantenaustritt
    let edge = 1.0 - (1.0 - l.fogAlpha);
    let band = smoothstep(0.0, 1.0, edge);
    out.colour = mix(out.colour, out.colour * vec3f(0.82, 0.86, 0.95), band * 0.5);
    return out;
}
```

## Texture sampling internals

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored from the live generator, c56)

How `bloxdTexel` / `bloxdTextureSize` actually compile — the 3-variant texture codegen. The user side: [Texture API](../api/texture-api.md).

### The three variants

#### Variant 1 — texture pack inactive (stubs)

```wgsl
fn bloxdTextureSize(bloxdSpMipLevel: f32) -> vec2u {
        return vec2u(1u);
}
fn bloxdTexel(bloxdSpTextureId: u32, bloxdSpUv: vec2f, bloxdSpMipLevel: f32) -> vec4f {
        return vec4f(1.0);
}
```

Code written for the real atlas still compiles and runs here — it just sees white texels and a 1×1 size.

#### Variant 2 — the atlas path (the game default)

`bloxdTextureSize` returns `textureDimensions(textureAtlas0, u32(clamp(round(bloxdSpMipLevel), 0.0, f32(textureNumLevels(textureAtlas0) - 1u))))`. `bloxdTexel` applies the face's quarter-turn before the load — the rotation trap written as the generated `bloxdSpTurned` if-chain:

```wgsl
        // Each quarter turn clockwise the face shows its texture at reads the unturned texture at (v, 1 - u)
        var bloxdSpTurned = bloxdSpUv;
        if (bloxdSpTextureRotation == 1u) {
                bloxdSpTurned = vec2f(bloxdSpUv.y, 1.0 - bloxdSpUv.x);
        } else if (bloxdSpTextureRotation == 2u) {
                bloxdSpTurned = 1.0 - bloxdSpUv;
        } else if (bloxdSpTextureRotation == 3u) {
                bloxdSpTurned = vec2f(1.0 - bloxdSpUv.y, bloxdSpUv.x);
        }
```

(`bloxdSpTextureRotation` is the engine's own storage of the input field `textureRotation`.)

#### Variant 3 — custom texture-pack textures

`textureLoad(<atlas>, min(bloxdSpCellAt * bloxdSpSize + bloxdSpAt, <dims> - 1u), bloxdSpLevel)` samples the layered atlas's per-texture cell; the pack's own texels go through the `bloxdSpOwnTexel` path.

### The animation frame ladder

Animated textures (42 families) advance at fixed per-family intervals (200 / 250 / 300 ms — the interval column in the [texture catalog](../api/texture-catalog.md#animation-families-42-names)). Passing an animation-family id to `bloxdTexel` samples the current frame.

### Sampler settings

The block textures are a `texture_2d_array`; the terrain sampler is nearest + repeat.

### Greedy meshing & UV

The mesher merges faces with matching material/AO/light into single rectangles (**greedy meshing**), so vertex UVs can exceed tile width on merged faces (0.0015 inset at edges). Hardware repeat addressing handles the tiling, so merged faces look seamless — but procedural detail keyed to `uv` can discontinuity across merge boundaries; key world-dependent effects to `bloxdWorldPosition(position)` instead.

## Texture registry internals

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (verified in production 2026-11-03) · Status: Verified (extracted by re-running the engine's own registry builder)

The name→id resolution machinery and measured registry drift. The user-facing catalog: [Texture catalog](../api/texture-catalog.md).

### Methodology

We ran the engine's own registry-building module (29833 on this build, coordinating modules 1371 / 1391 / 1384 / 219) against the shipped block registry's texture data inside a mini webpack harness and recorded its output — these numbers are **the production bundle's own computation**, not a re-implementation.

### Output structure

| Output | v5 measured | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `named` | **896** | names referable as `bloxdTextureId<Name>` |
| `aliases` | 416 | folded spellings — 188 frame aliases (`lava0`…) and 228 rotation aliases (`chest_top[rot[1`…) |
| `layers` | 228 | the layer table — including 171 pre-rotated slots (57 roots × 4 rotations) |

### Folding rules

- **animation families** (42): frame spellings (`lava0`–`lava7`) fold to the base name (`lava`); `bloxdTexel` returns the current frame at sample time
- **rotation families** (57): turned slots (`[rot[1..4`) fold to the root name; `bloxdTexel` re-applies per-face `textureRotation`
- `radar_screen` is the only name in both families (its four pre-rotated copies each carry their own 4-frame ladder — hence 45 animation roots on the atlas, not 42)

### Drift (cnty9 → ab90qa)

| Measurement | cnty9 (v4) | ab90qa (v5) |
|---|---|---|
| atlas entries | 1,219 | **1,210** |
| rotation families (turned spellings) | 57 (228) | **57 (228) — unchanged** |
| animation families (frame spellings) | 42 (188) | **42 (188) — unchanged** |
| usable named constants | 905 | **896** |
| id changes among surviving names | — | **334 of 905** |

The complete drift (11 names): added (1) `scorpion_eggs`; removed (10) the eight double-chest textures plus `mob_spawner_hostile_block_side` / `mob_spawner_neutral_block_side` (the double chest left the game data; spawners keep `mob_spawner_block_top`).

### Effect on HEADER_VERSION

The registry-hash suffix bakes in ids, so this drift marks **every saved pack "needs re-check"** (auto re-validated on page load). Name-written packs survive re-resolution; raw-id packs break ([Compatibility](../api/compatibility.md)).

### Past drift records

October's two-build comparison (sjr0p7 → cnty9, 10 days): entries 1200 → 1219 (98 added, 79 removed); 779 of 1121 unchanged names changed id (69%); a naming-convention migration (`_rot1..4` suffixes → `[rot[1..4` slots); the double chest appearing. The full record lives in [Version History: v4](../history/v4.md).

## Model rendering internals

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Analyzed (restored from the live bundle)

The internals of the v5 Model program. The user-facing guide: [Models and textures](../guides/models.md).

### What the Model program is

Before v5, packs could only plug into terrain / liquid; block models (slabs, stairs, plants) and entities (players, mobs, items) were **outside pack jurisdiction**. v5 added model as the third program, drawing:

- blocks drawn as block models (header note: *"Drawn as block models, so never part of terrain or flagged as opaque"*)
- held / dropped / thrown items
- players, mobs, NPCs (armour and cosmetics included)

### Flag & input delivery

- **`bloxdSpFlags`** — the delivery path for the `BloxdFlags` struct; the 8 new fields (`slab` / `stairs` / `flat` / `placed` / `held` / `dropped` / `thrown` / `lifeform`) carry values meaningful only on model faces
- **`bloxdSpItemLocalPosition`** — delivery of `localPosition`; `vec3f(0.0)` on terrain/liquid
- **`bloxdSpEnchant`** — delivery of the enchant inputs (`enchantTier` / `enchantColour` / `enchantSpeed`)

### Enchant computation

The engine animates the glint sweep and delivers it as `enchantColour.a` to the surface/light hooks ([Enchant effects](../recipes/enchant-effects.md)). The mixing happens inside `bloxdLitColour()` — right after shading, before world light ([Lighting](../api/lighting.md#the-full-pipeline)).

### The overlay (hurt flash etc.)

`overlayColour` carries entity state color (damage flash etc.) as RGB + alpha. `bloxdLitColour` mixes it **before lighting**, so state expression rides without breaking the base color. The processing existed internally in v4 and was opened to inputs/outputs in v5.

### The texture path

Most model faces use `textureId: 0` (no texture) — player skins and mob textures are not in the block-texture-atlas namespace. `surface.colour` arrives with skin × tint baked in, so model-face processing starts from `colour` ([model-owned textures](../api/texture-api.md#model-owned-textures-textureid-0)).

### Variants

The Model program forms one axis of the variant matrix: `strict.model` / `allow.model`. `BLOXD_ALPHA` is defined only in allow.model ([Preprocessor](../api/preprocessor.md#macro--variant-matrix)); strict.model has no vertex hooks.

## Engine data ledger (v5 measurements)

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` (2026-11-03; production = preprod, byte-identical) · Status: Verified

The documentation's v5 measurement ledger — every confirmed value, all measured on `ab90qa`.

### The ledger

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| `apiVersion` | `5` (strict `===`, number) |
| engine header | 8,954 B decoded / 208 lines (9,125 B as shipped, 6 interpolations). First line `// The Bloxd shader pack API, apiVersion 5. Read-only, prepended to all packs.` — full text in [Engine header](engine-header.md) |
| hooks | 9 (terrain/liquid/model × vertex/surface/light). Names unchanged; the default template bundles all 9 |
| variants | 6 (strict × program). Names `strict\|allow.terrain\|liquid\|model` — the lighting axis is gone |
| macros | `BLOXD_STRICT` (strict) · `BLOXD_ALPHA` (all liquid + non-strict terrain/model) · `BLOXD_SCENE_DEPTH` (all liquid) · ~~`BLOXD_LIGHTING`~~ **removed** |
| pack uniform | `@group(3) @binding(0)`, 64 B: seconds@0, **lit@4 (u32, new)**, renderOffset@16, sunDirection@32, eyePosition@48 |
| pack bindings | group 3: 0 uniform · 1 scene depth (liquid) · 2 `bloxdSpTextureLayers` storage |
| flags | the `BloxdFlags` struct, 14 bools; v4's bit values retired |
| loader limits | 256 `.wgsl` / 256 KB source / 64 KB `pack.json` / 32 MB zip / 1,024 entries; UTF-8; one manifest; unique paths — all unchanged |
| texture registry | 1,210 entries → **896 usable names**; drift vs cnty9 +1/−10 ([Texture registry](texture-registry.md)) |
| light curve | 0–15 levels → 0–1, ease-out (`6 → 0.45`, `12 → 0.92`) — in the header, unchanged |
| lift curve | `1 - (1 - x / (3 - 2x))^3` — unchanged (currently chunk c9) |
| directional cone | `0.12 / 0.65 / 0.62 / 0.95` — unchanged (chunk c9) |
| fog color | `vec3f(183/255, 191/255, 195/255)` — unchanged |
| reserved names | `/^bloxd/i` (case-insensitive) + the 46 `bloxdSp*` engine symbols ([Reserved identifiers](reserved-identifiers.md)) |
| HEADER_VERSION | `9.<fnv1a32(header)>.<fnv1a32(texture registry)>` |
| strict titles | everything except the 12 allow titles in [Policy](policy.md) (re-verified on ab90qa, unchanged) |
| header/registry builders | chunk c55 (module 29833 + 1371 + 1391 + 1384 + 219 coordinating) |
| default pack template | chunk c116 (moved from v4's c124), 1,683 B |

### Bundle layout (for re-surveyors)

The shader-pipeline cluster: loader/persistence c51–c53, validator/header/registry builder c55, WebGPU/codegen c56, fog c9. **The default pack template is c116** (c124 in v4).

Chunk-format note: every chunk is an ES module (`export const modules = {...}`) — c53 carries both c52's and c53's modules — so plain-text search of the bundle remains meaningful (module id `1371` lives in *main*'s sparse module array, in no chunk).

The main bundle is 3.39 MB (+115 KB vs the v4 build); the chunk map has 195 IDs (188 emitted, 7 known gaps).

### Past ledgers

- v4 (cnty9, 2026-10-27) → [Version History: v4](../history/v4.md)
- v3 (3ymzdd, 2026-10-19) → [Version History: v3](../history/v3.md)

## Was sichtbare Paket-Werte ändert — Testcheckliste



Dasselbe Paket rendert je nach **Welt und Spieler-Einstellungen** anders. Vor Verteilung mindestens diese 3 Umgebungen prüfen:

1. **Normalwelt** (Default-Skybox, keine Overrides) — bloxdSunDirection() ≈ `(−0.56, 0.81, −0.18)`, Standardfarben
2. **Space-Skybox-Welt** — bloxdSunDirection() = 0. Der `sunPresent`-Zweig-Look
3. **Custom-Welt mit `visionMinLightColour` / `skyLightColourOverride`** — gehobene Dunkelheiten und Farben

Haupt-Varianzquellen: `lightingOverride` (Zwangslicht) / `skyLightColourOverride`, `ambientLightColourOverride` (Hex-Tausch) / `visionMinLightColour` („dunkelste sichtbare Farbe". Als Komponenten-Maximum gegen sowohl `uSkyLightColour` als auch `uAmbientLightColour` implementiert; Night Vision nutzt es — „stockdunkle Höhlen"-Pakete werden nicht so dunkel wie gedacht, und die Himmelsfarbe selbst wird angehoben) / `heldLightColourOverride`, `Range`, `ConeAngle` / `fogChunkDistanceOverride`, `fogColourOverride`, `fogOnSkybox` / `skyBox` (bloxdSunDirection()-Präsenz). `uSkyLightColour`-Standard = (1,1,1) weiß, `uAmbientLightColour`-Standard = (0.25,0.25,0.30). `l.ambient`-Szenenseite = Grafik-Einstellung „Ambient Lighting Intensity" (Standard 0.5). `(1.0 - l.fogAlpha)` folgt Spieler-Fog/Chunk-Distanz-Einstellungen. Auch `cameraTint` (RGBA-Tönung über den ganzen Bildschirm) und `proximityFadeDistance` / `proximityFadeMinOpacity` (Kamera-Nähe-Fade für Entities) sind Welt-Einstellungs-Varianzfaktoren — `cameraTint` ist insbesondere ein Final-Pass, der **über** die Paket-Ausgabe komponiert wird. Vieles davon lässt sich auch per Script-API (`serverOption`) setzen und während des Spiels aktualisieren.

## Anwendungsmodi je Spiel (`shaderPackPolicy`)



Dieser Abschnitt präzisiert, was „allow / strict" auf Titelebene bedeutet (vgl. §7). Nur Titel, deren Spieldefinition ausdrücklich `shaderPackPolicy: "allow"` enthält, laufen im vollen Modus (Vertex-Hooks, `discard`, Terrain-`alpha`); Titel ohne Angabe (oder mit einem anderen Wert) sind strict — `BLOXD_STRICT` wird definiert, umschlossener Code automatisch deaktiviert. Das Paket kann dies nicht selbst wählen; zu wissen, in welchen Titeln was läuft, ist Voraussetzung für das Verteilen.

- Referenz-Build: `szby6g.main.94a7596c.js` (Produktions-Deployment zum 2026-10-17). Statische Auswertung aller 111 Spieldefinitionen: **26 allow-Einträge (12 Titel) / 85 strict-Einträge**. Dieselben 12 allow-Literale in denselben 12 Titeln wurden im v3-Produktions-Bundle (`3ymzdd`, 2026-10-20) unverändert erneut bestätigt — die folgende Liste gilt wortgleich auch für v3.
- Oberhalb von `shaderPackPolicy` gibt es ein Gate auf Auslieferungskanal-Ebene (grob `canUseShaderPacks`): Über externe Portale (z. B. Coolmath-Games-Builds) kann das Shader-Paket-System selbst deaktiviert sein, bevor `shaderPackPolicy` überhaupt konsultiert wird. Die Allow/Strict-Analyse unten basiert auf dem bloxd.io-Haupt-Web-Build.
- allow wird an 12 Stellen deklariert: 8 direkte Literale in den Spieldefinitionen und 4 Basisvariablen (`tb` / `kz` / `cb` / `Fb`); Varianten erben über Spread (`{...tb,...}`). Eine Übersteuerung pro Variante (Eltern-allow / Kind-strict) gibt es derzeit nicht.

Die 12 allow-Titel (insgesamt 26 Einträge):

- **Test Gym** — Basis + Empty / Mobs / Mobs & Worldgen / Schematic / Fragment Shader / Item Drops / Bot Armour / Void / Busy / Particles (insgesamt 11 Einträge)
- **Doodle Cube** — Basis + Solos / Duos (3)
- **Rocket Obby** — Basis + Sheep / January (3)
- **9 Einzeltitel**: Creative (`classic_creative`) / Bloxd Hop / Fishing / Dress Up / Evil Tower / Plots / Test Mode (`schematicTester`) / Tsunami Steal Brainrots / Work at a Restaurant (`cooking`)

Die missverständlichsten Punkte auf der strict-Seite:

- **Superflat Creative (classic_creativeFlat) ist strict.** Der Name enthält „Creative", aber in der classic-Familie ist nur das normale Creative (`classic_creative`) allow. Peaceful / Survival / SMP / Worlds / Anarchy / Survival with Guns usw. sind komplett strict
- **Custom Games (customGames) ist strict.** Vertex-Hook-Effekte feuern nicht in selbst erstellten Custom Games. Zum Verifizieren ist Test Gym die sichere Wahl
- Große PvP-/Server-Titel wie bedwars / skywars / skyblock / oneBlock / greenville / pirates / shooting (cubeWarfare) sind allesamt strict

Auch in strict-Titeln wird das Paket geladen und kompiliert; Fragment-Rezepte wie surface / light funktionieren normal. Eingeschränkt sind die Vertex-Hooks (`bloxdTerrainVertex` / `bloxdLiquidVertex`), `discard` und Terrain-`alpha` (bei Flüssigkeiten stets vorhanden).

Diese Liste spiegelt die statische Analyse des genannten Builds wider; Engine-Updates können die allow/strict-Aufteilung ändern. Bei neuen Versionen nachkontrollieren.

## Sonnen- und Mondidentität



Die `bloxdSunDirection()`-Quelle ist ein Sonnenrichtungs-Buffer, der nur bei Skybox-Typwechsel neu geschrieben wird — Kriterium ist nicht „ob der Himmel eine Sonne hat", sondern **„ob die Skybox vom Erdtyp ist"**.

| Skybox | `bloxdSunDirection()` |
|---|---|
| `default` (prozeduraler Himmel) | Nicht null (Defaults unten) |
| `gloomy` / `interstellar` / `space_*` (Cube-Texturen) | **Immer (0,0,0)** |

**Der Mond ist immer `-bloxdSunDirection()`** (die Engine berechnet die Mondposition als exaktes Gegenteil der Sonne). Nacht wird per Sonnenhöhe beurteilt — Mond oben bei `bloxdSunDirection().y < 0` (Sonne unterm Horizont). In Standardwelten ist die Sonne aber statisch, der Mond also auch — nur Welten mit Tag/Nacht-Zyklus sehen ihn wandern.

Die Standardwelt-Sonnenrichtung liegt bei ca. `(-0.56, 0.81, -0.18)` (Einheitsvektor aus inclination = −0.2 / azimuth = 0.55, statisch). Praktische Referenz zur Vorhersage von Highlight-Richtungen beim Testen von Vertriebspaketen.

Tag/Nacht-Zyklen sind nicht in die Engine eingebaut — inclination ist eine statische Zahl, die Welten mit bewegtem Tag spielsietig aktualisieren. `bloxdSunDirection()` folgt jeder Aktualisierung.

Terrain-Richtlichter sind nur 2 Lampen beim Szenenstart, mit **fixer Richtung und Intensität, ohne Tag/Nacht-Wechsel**. Kurz: **Kein Terrain-Helligkeitsfaktor hängt von der Zeit ab. Tag/Nacht-„Looks" kommen nur aus Skybox und bloxdSunDirection()**, also müssen nachts abdunkelnde Pakete die Zeitspanne selbst aus bloxdSunDirection() schätzen (die `sunPresent`-Technik aus §19).

### R-A. Gerichtetes Mondlicht — moonDir = −bloxdSunDirection()

Addiert bläulich-weißes Lambert und schwaches Specular nur solange der Mond oben ist. `moonUp` ist in statischen Standardwelten 0: dort passiert nichts — **Mondlicht, das nur in Welten mit Tag/Nacht-Zyklus feuert, also sicher**.

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    if (bloxdLit()) {
        // der Mond ist immer exakt gegenüber der Sonne; Tages-Auto-Off via moonDir.y < 0
        let moonDir = -bloxdSunDirection();
        let moonUp  = smoothstep(0.0, 0.15, moonDir.y);
        if (moonUp > 0.0) {
            let n     = normalize(l.normal);
            let diff  = max(0.0, dot(n, moonDir));
            let view  = normalize(bloxdEyePosition() - l.position);
            let halfV = normalize(moonDir + view);
            let spec  = pow(max(0.0, dot(n, halfV)), 48.0) * 0.25;
            out.colour += vec3f(0.10, 0.14, 0.24) * (diff * 0.6 + spec) * moonUp;
        }
}
    return out;
}
```

## Debugging-Mittel



- URL-Parameter `?renderer=lite` — den Lite-Renderer (WebGPU) erzwingen (`?renderer=webgl2` / `babylon` gehen auch; `babylon` ist der alte Name für webgl2). Priorität: URL-Parameter > localStorage `bloxdRenderer` > Einstellungsbildschirm > Standard (webgl2). Ungültige Werte werden mit Warnung ignoriert. In URL oder localStorage belassene Overrides können Szenen brechen, die WebGPU (lite) brauchen — „needs the new WebGPU renderer, so remove the renderer override..." ([Teil V](../troubleshooting/) §17)
- URL-Parameter `?vconsole` — On-Screen-Konsole (VConsole). Praktisch für echte Mobil-Verifikation
- URL-Parameter `?drawcalls=1` — blendet ein Draw-Statistik-Debug-Panel ein. Spielobjekte aus der Debug-Konsole auswählen oder `drawCalls()` / `why()` / `configureDrawCallWatching()` nutzen, um Overdraw großer Mechanismen (Paket und sonstige) und die Annäherung ans Limit von ~65.000 Vertices pro Draw-Call zu inspizieren — nützlich zur Isolation von Performance-Engpässen
- Die Konsole zeigt `noa-engine v0.33.0` und `Renderer: lite from <Quelle>` — erst prüfen, um Render-Pfad-Fehldiagnosen zu vermeiden
- Der WebGPU-Renderer sperrt sich mit Paket auf „zwangsweise AN". Die Einstellung „Disable Block Texture Atlas" sperrt sich ebenfalls (Atlas bleibt AN), und ohne WebGPU wendet sich das Paket gar nicht erst an. Basis, um auf Vertriebsseiten „WebGPU-Browser nötig" zu schreiben
- Block-Texturen sind eine 2D-Array-Textur (`texture_2d_array`), der Terrain-Sampler ist Nearest + Repeat. Der Mesher verschmilzt außerdem Flächen mit gleichem Material / AO / Licht zu einem Rechteck (**Greedy Meshing**), die UV einer verschmolzenen Fläche kann daher eine Kachelbreite überschreiten (Kanten um 0.0015 eingerückt). Hardware-Repeat-Adressierung übernimmt die Kachelung, verschmolzene Flächen wirken nahtlos. Beachte: an `vUV` gekoppeltes prozedurales Detail kann an Verschmelzungsgrenzen brechen — stattdessen an die Weltposition (`s.position` + `bloxdRenderOffset()`) koppeln
- Die Laufzeit-Revalidierung pro Beitritt (`checkCompilation`) kompiliert echte Terrain-Materialien im Browser-WebGPU (strenger als Einstellungs-Static-Validierung). Hier fallende Pakete werden aus diesem Spiel ausgeschlossen

## Research log

> Status: Verified — how this documentation's measurements were obtained

The technical statements here rest not on official developer documentation but on **production-bundle analysis**. This page records methodology and evidence so future builds can be re-verified.

### Core principles

1. **Direct production-bundle retrieval** — raw main.js and chunks fetched from both production and preprod, identity verified by md5
2. **Verbatim respect** — headers, error messages and i18n strings are **quoted as-is**, never paraphrased
3. **Reproduced measurement** — derived values like the registry are recomputed by running the engine's own modules in a harness (real output, not a lookalike re-implementation)
4. **Named builds** — every measurement carries a build id and date

### Build history referenced by this documentation

| Build | API | Date | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `szby6g` | v3-era | 2026-10-17 | first allow/strict static analysis (111 game definitions) |
| `3ymzdd` | v3 | 2026-10-20 | the v3 guide's evidence build |
| `sjr0p7` | v3-era | 2026-10-17 | drift-comparison baseline |
| `cnty9` | v4 | 2026-10-27 | v4 guide & 905-name catalog evidence |
| `6pf78` / `tcwczu` | v4 | 2026-10-31 | v4 freeze confirmation (Halloween event + Skyblock rework) |
| `ab90qa` | **v5** | 2026-11-03 | **current**; this documentation's baseline. prod = preprod (md5 `fc3322212d15be2445c0e8dfc9733fcc`) |

### Key methodology

#### Engine-header restoration

Rendering the c55 header template with its live interpolations (`${vC}` = apiVersion, the 5 uniform reads via `${Gq.j}`) — 6 interpolations on v5 ([Engine header](engine-header.md)).

#### Texture-registry recomputation

Running the engine's registry-building modules (29833 + 1371 + 1391 + 1384 + 219) against the shipped block registry's texture data in a mini webpack harness; recording the output (named 896 / aliases 416 / layers 228) ([Texture registry](texture-registry.md)).

Animation intervals come from the `animDataPerTex`-style table (per-layer `numAnimStates` / `animationInterval`) — only three interval values exist: 200 / 250 / 300 ms ([the catalog](../api/texture-catalog.md#animation-families-42-names)).

#### Error-message capture

Loader messages verbatim from the live i18n dictionary; validator messages from the validation module's string literals.

#### allow / strict static analysis

Statically analyzing all 111 game definitions: `shaderPackPolicy` `"allow"` literals — 8 direct + 4 base-variable = 12 titles (26 entries), spread-inheritance (`{...tb,...}`) tracked too ([Policy](policy.md)).

#### Uniform / pipeline restoration

The `BloxdPackInputs` field layout from the uniform-layout module (29838); the texture 3-variant codegen from the WebGPU generator (c56) ([Texture sampling](texture-sampling.md)).

### Drift observations

| Comparison | Period | Result |
|---|---|---|
| sjr0p7 → cnty9 | 10 days | 98 added, 79 removed; 779/1121 names changed id (69%) |
| cnty9 → ab90qa | 7 days | +1 (scorpion_eggs), −10 (double chest ×8, spawner sides ×2); 334/905 names changed id |

### Unverified / speculative

- Pixel-accurate shadow maps as "future plans" is an **interpretation** (inferred from the unused `var shadow: f32 = 1.;` in the lighting template)
- The allow/strict split can change per build (12-title identity re-confirmed on ab90qa; future games unknown)
- Why `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition` remains in the signature table (removed from v5's header) is unanalyzed — plausibly an un-cleaned leftover, but unconfirmed

### When to re-verify

On detecting a game update (a new main.js hash): re-check the header (9,125B), the apiVersion constant, recompute the registry, and re-confirm the allow/strict list. Detailed monitoring methodology is outside this documentation's scope, but the module locations above (c55 / c116 / c56) are the starting points.
