## Browser

Shader packs are WebGPU-renderer only. You need a WebGPU-capable browser:

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome / Edge / Opera etc.) — stable on desktop
- Safari 17+ / Firefox (WebGPU support varies by period)
- **Mobile**: WebGPU support may be limited on iOS / Android. Mention this on your pack's release page

While a pack is installed, the game setting for the WebGPU renderer is force-enabled.

## Development environment

No special tooling is required, though these help:

- A text editor (WGSL syntax highlighting is a plus)
- A zip tool for distribution; during development you can use folder loading (desktop browsers only)
- Browser developer tools — compile errors show in the in-game UI and also in the console

## On-device verification environments

Before distribution, verify on ([Validation](validation.md)):

1. An allow-mode game (mandatory if you use vertex animation)
2. A strict-mode game (most games are strict)
3. A page reload (saved packs re-validate automatically)

## URL parameter caveat

Leftover renderer overrides in URL parameters or localStorage make packs refuse to start — clear them and reload.
