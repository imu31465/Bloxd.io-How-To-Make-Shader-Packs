# Compilation errors

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

Errors that pass static validation but fail as WGSL, or fail only in the browser's WGSL compiler (stage 2).

## "bloxdTerrainVertex must be declared as: fn ..."

- **Cause**: hook signature mismatch (argument/return types)
- **Fix**: rewrite to the declaration shown in the message (parameter names are free; types must match exactly)
- **Prevention**: start from the [hook comparison table](../api/hooks.md)

## "mixing '*' and '^' requires parenthesis (only in ...)"

- **Cause**: WGSL requires parentheses when mixing `^` `&` `|` `<<` `>>` with other operators
- **Fix**: parenthesize the operands

## "... can only be a function's parameter or return type, ..."

- **Cause**: `var x: BloxdSurface;` — bare type-annotated declarations are rejected because header structs gain fields
- **Fix**: `var out = bloxdDefaultSurface(s);` (or `var out = s;` in light hooks)
- **Prevention**: always build outputs from `bloxdDefault*` ([conventions](../api/structures.md#writing-conventions-recap))

## "_ can only be the target of a phony assignment, as in _ = f();"

- **Cause**: `let _ = f();` is invalid WGSL
- **Fix**: write `_ = f();`

## "Lite: …reads scene depth on a page that didn't turn it on"

- **Cause**: a depth-reading pack (`bloxdOpaqueBehind`) was active when the page was generated; depth availability is decided at page generation
- **Fix**: reload the page with the pack active

## dpdy sign looks inverted

- **This is by design**: the analyzer auto-rewrites every `dpdy` / `dpdyCoarse` / `dpdyFine` call to `(-dpdy(...))` (screen-space y points down)
- **Fix**: nothing — write `dpdy(h)` with the intent "how does h change going up" and the emitted code carries the flip ([Restrictions](../api/restrictions.md#automatic-rewrites))
- `dpdx` and `fwidth` are untouched

## Pack gets dropped on game join / the on-device check never finishes

- **Cause**: the on-device check failed, or hit the 60-second forced timeout (`skipped`) — common on low-spec devices and heavy worlds
- **Fix**: reduce heavy vertex work and complex loops; see [Performance](performance.md)
