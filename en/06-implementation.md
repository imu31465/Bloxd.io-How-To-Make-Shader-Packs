# Part VI: Important implementation notes

## 19. Fixing "shadows dark but surfaces bright" at night

Darkening only shadows leaves the engine finished color (`engineColour`) bright when there is no sun, making the face/shadow gap unnatural. Decay the whole finished color instead.

The example below treats zero `bloxdSunDirection()` as night and directional sun as day, decaying terrain finished colors at dark hours. Where `blockLight` and `heldLight` are strong, decay weakens to preserve nearby lamps like torches. `0.52` is a tuning value — lower it for darker nights.

```wgsl
fn bloxdTerrainLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let sunPresent = smoothstep(0.0, 0.5, length(bloxdSunDirection()));
    let nightDim = mix(0.52, 1.0, sunPresent);
    var scale = nightDim;
    #ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING
    let blockAmt = max(l.blockLight.r, max(l.blockLight.g, l.blockLight.b));
    let heldAmt = max(l.heldLight.r, max(l.heldLight.g, l.heldLight.b));
    let localLight = clamp(max(blockAmt, heldAmt), 0.0, 1.0);
    let protectLocalLight = smoothstep(0.03, 0.35, localLight);
    scale = mix(nightDim, 1.0, protectLocalLight);
    #endif
    // decay the finished color; add material emission through fog as default
    out.colour = l.engineColour * scale + s.emission * l.fogVisibility;
    return out;
}
```

**Limits of this fix:** if `bloxdSunDirection()` behaves as "unit direction with sun, zero without", day/night can be told apart but dusk/twilight cannot be smoothly estimated. And since it decays the finished color, it weakens engine daylight and ambient together — not a full time-of-day reproduction. To apply the same to liquids, check the liquid hook fallback relationship.

## 20. Integrated recipe for natural-looking water

This API cannot sample scene color, so this is **pseudo styling with fresnel-style color blending and sun highlights, not real reflection/refraction** (depth math became possible in v2 with `bloxdOpaqueBehind()`, split out to [Part VIII](08-apiv2.md) R-E). The sample below keeps the base color, blends slightly toward a sky-like color at grazing view angles, and adds a small glint only when the sun exists.

```wgsl
fn pack_waterWaveNormal(p: vec3f, t: f32) -> vec3f {
    let c1 = cos(p.x * 1.00 + t * 1.60);
    let c2 = cos(p.z * 1.35 + t * 1.28);
    let c3 = cos((p.x + p.z) * 0.70 - t * 1.76);
    let dhdx = 0.50 * c1 + 0.15 * 0.70 * c3;
    let dhdz = 0.35 * 1.35 * c2 + 0.15 * 0.70 * c3;
    return normalize(vec3f(-dhdx * 0.55, 1.0, -dhdz * 0.55));
}

fn bloxdLiquidLight(s: BloxdSurface, l: BloxdLightIn) -> BloxdLight {
    var out = bloxdDefaultLight(s, l);
    let baseN = normalize(l.normal);
    let viewDir = normalize(bloxdEyePosition() - l.position);
    let facing = clamp(dot(baseN, viewDir), 0.0, 1.0);
    let fresnel = 0.02 + 0.98 * pow(1.0 - facing, 5.0);
    let fakeSkyReflection = vec3f(0.16, 0.29, 0.36);
    out.colour *= vec3f(0.88, 0.97, 1.04);
    out.colour = mix(out.colour, fakeSkyReflection, fresnel * 0.38);
    #ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING
    let worldPos = bloxdWorldPosition(l.position);
    let topness = clamp(baseN.y * 2.0, 0.0, 1.0);
    let waveN = normalize(mix(baseN, pack_waterWaveNormal(worldPos, bloxdTime()), topness));
    let sunLen = length(bloxdSunDirection());
    if (sunLen > 0.5) {
        let sunDir = bloxdSunDirection() / sunLen;
        let halfDir = normalize(viewDir + sunDir);
        let glint = pow(max(dot(waveN, halfDir), 0.0), 180.0) * 0.55 * clamp(l.skyLight, 0.0, 1.0);
        out.colour += vec3f(1.0, 0.97, 0.90) * glint;
    }
    #endif
    return out;
}
```

Tuning pointers:

- Water looks white/washed: lower `0.38` in `fresnel * 0.38` and the glint `0.55`.
- Water looks too dark: blend a bit more `fakeSkyReflection`. Too much looks plasticky.
- Lines or regular stripes on water: lower wave frequencies and glint strength. This code has no mesh vertex displacement.
- Want real scenery reflections: this API's inputs have no screen color, so blending colors never becomes real reflection (depth is liquid-only. [Part VIII](08-apiv2.md) R-E).

This recipe **replaces** an existing `bloxdLiquidLight`. Don't paste it alongside R9.7's same-named wave function or other same-named hooks.

## 21. In-game test checklist

Compile success and "good looks" are different things. Check in this order:

1. **Loading:** `pack.json` is at the ZIP root; settings show `Ready to use`.
2. **8 variants:** no type-guard omissions across strict / allow, lighting on / off, terrain / liquid. Even if a game only uses some conditions, distribution packs should assume all 8.
3. **Daytime:** no blown colors per material (grass, stone, sand, wood); natural bright/dark split between tops and sides.
4. **Night:** compare same materials in former daylight, shadows, and near torches. If only lit faces remain, tune exposure decay; if everything is dark, tune local-light protection.
5. **Water:** look from above, grazing angles, shores, underwater, and night separately. Alpha behavior and underwater looks depend on the game's compositing — never judge from one viewpoint. Underwater, the liquid-definition veil covers frontmost per [Part VII](07-internals.md) discussion, so pack differences show mainly on the surface and terrain through the veil.
6. **Borders and distance:** no popping waves/patterns at chunk / origin transitions; no double fog or white haze in the distance.
7. **Performance:** effects heavy on per-fragment hash/trig/`pow` calls should be minimal. Add detail gradually and compare FPS.

### Known constraints as premises

- Shader packs are limited to terrain / liquid hooks — no same-code handling of sky, entities, or UI.
- No inputs exist for adding shadow maps, screen-space reflections, refraction, bloom, etc. (scene depth is unlocked liquid-only as `bloxdOpaqueBehind()`. See [Part VIII](08-apiv2.md)).
- `bloxdTime()` is animation time with no guaranteed link to in-game day/night.
- Zero `bloxdSunDirection()` means true moon direction is unknown, not "moonlight physics" but a mood approximation. Directional moonlight can be built from `-bloxdSunDirection()` (day/night-cycle worlds only. [Part VII](07-internals.md) R-A).
- `s.position` / `l.position` are local coordinates, so add `bloxdOriginOffset()` for world-dependent effects. For in-block-local patterns, local coordinates are intentionally the tool.

## 22. Combining with other packs when shaders alone hit limits

Since shader packs cannot add or sample textures, don't try to solve fine material bumpiness or sky image changes with shaders alone. The public texture-pack repository for Bloxd.io [Bloxdy/texture-packs](https://github.com/Bloxdy/texture-packs) handles textures, skybox, models, etc. through a different system.

For reference, community "cinematic shader" distributions analyzed in one case turned out to be texture packs (128x128 textures with no `pack.json` / `.wgsl`).

In practice, **tune light and color with shaders, and cover materials and sky with a matching resource pack**. But verify co-use and load order against the game's implementation and settings.

## 23. Underwater reality with shader packs

Underwater looks consist of 3 layers:

| Layer | Content | Operable from packs? |
|---|---|---|
| ① Terrain/liquid rendering | Hook-processable. Light hooks are called normally underwater | Yes (works "under the veil") |
| ② Liquid-definition veil | Emissive fullscreen quad from the liquid block definition color/alpha at the camera position, drawn frontmost. The game setting `cameraTint` wins if set | No (neither color nor density changeable) |
| ③ cameraTint | Game setting | No |

Practical points: packs keep working underwater / the veil cannot be removed / underwater cannot be branched on (fogStart / fogEnd / fogColour don't change underwater, so fogVisibility can't detect it either).
