# Part IV: Realism guide

> The live game has required `apiVersion: 3` since 2026-10-19 and rejects v1/v2 packs at load — the content below is written against the v2 specification; see [Part IX](09-apiv3.md) for migration before you distribute anything.

## 13. Engine default lighting and headroom for realism

Engine default lighting is "multiplication only" — no specular, fresnel, warm/cool separation, or hemisphere ambient exists. The following can be rebuilt:

| Feature | Default | Buildable in packs? |
|---|---|---|
| Diffuse (Lambert) | Scalar sum of directional lights only | ◎ Custom with `bloxdSunDirection()` (wrapped falloff etc.) |
| Specular | None | ◎ Blinn-Phong (R9.2) |
| Fresnel | None | ◎ Schlick approximation (R9.3) |
| Warm-torch / cool-sky separation | Uncolored | ◎ (R9.1) |
| Hemisphere ambient | Directionless only | ◎ Sky above / ground below (R9.4) |
| Tone mapping | None (clamp only) | ◎ ACES filmic (R9.5) |
| Aerial perspective | Fog (color replacement) only | ◎ Distance desaturation (R9.6) |
| Surface detail | Texture resolution only | △ Procedural hash-noise micro-bump (R9.8) |
| Vertex waves (water) | None (flat) | ◎ Allow only (R7) |
| Wave normals / sun glitter | None | ◎ (R9.7) |
| Night moonlight | Sky color just darkens | △ No moon direction input, so only pseudo looks (blue ambient in R2 / desaturation in R9.11) |
| Shadows (sky-occlusion) | Gently blended via `mix(ambient, sky, skyLight)` only | ◎ Lift inversion + threshold cut + sun gate (R9.12). Tree shade and under-roof areas drop clearly, following block edits in real time |

## 14. Two implementation schools

**School A: additive fixes (from defaultLight)** — use `engineColour` (finished color) as the base and add warm glow or rim. Easy and safe, but the lighting model stays default.

**School B: full relighting (from s.colour)** — discard `l.engineColour` and rebuild lighting from `s.colour` (albedo) and raw LightIn materials. The real path to realism. Four rules:

1. **Re-apply fog**: the light hook runs post-fog, so apply `mix(l.fogColour, col, l.fogVisibility)` yourself (R9.10). When fog is too dense, floor it with `max(l.fogVisibility, 0.3)`. Conversely, mixing more fog color onto engineColour-based packs double-fogs into white distance
2. **Unlit fallback**: pass through to `defaultLight` outside `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING`
3. **Guard whole shared functions**: wrap shared functions taking `BloxdLightIn` in `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` as entire functions (guarding only call sites is not enough)
4. **When there is no sun direction**: if `bloxdSunDirection()` is zero, don't compute directional specular. `l.directional` is a light-amount scalar, not a direction vector, so it cannot restore highlight direction. Switch to weak directionless ambient as needed. Moon direction is available via `-bloxdSunDirection()` (only moves in day/night-cycle worlds. [Part VII](07-internals.md) R-A)

## 15. Unreachable looks (the realism "ceiling")

| Look | Reason |
|---|---|
| Pixel-accurate shadow maps (sun-tracking shadows, penumbra) | Depth textures cannot be referenced (liquid-only `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` is geometry-only and unusable as a shadow map). Light-ray occlusion is not fed into hooks |
| SSAO | No scene-depth access (only mesher-baked vertex AO; liquid-only depth is unusable for SSAO) |
| SSR (reflections) | No scene color. Only pseudo looks blending sky color via fresnel |
| Bloom / glare | No hook into post-processing |
| Depth of field, chromatic aberration, grain | Full-screen post-processing required |
| Volumetric light (god rays) | Same |
| PBR textures | Texture reads prohibited. Only pseudo estimation from color luminance |
| Underwater refraction | No scene color. Liquid-only depth (`bloxdOpaqueBehind()`) enables thickness absorption and bottom projection ([Part VIII](08-apiv2.md) R-E) |
| Underwater veil (blue tint) removal / change | The veil is an emissive fullscreen quad generated from the liquid block definition color/alpha the camera is in, drawn outside hook pipelines (frontmost), so packs can change neither its color nor density |
| Direct underwater detection | No input indicates camera submersion, and fogStart / fogEnd / fogColour don't change underwater, so there is no reliable way to estimate underwater from fogVisibility etc. |

### The truth about shadows — "tree shadows" are buildable

Only **sun-tracking pixel-accurate shadow maps** are impossible in the table above. The engine already computes "shadows" from the start, and that is `skyLight`. The mesh-side LightEngine runs a Minecraft-style algorithm:

1. **Column scan**: scan each (x,z) column top to bottom. Light from the sky starts at 15, becomes **0 at opaque blocks**, dimming down with `lightFilter` (air 1 / water 3 / opaque 15)
2. **BFS flood fill**: spreads sideways to 6 neighbors (-1 per block) — this is what softens shadow edges. Raw value under radius-r occlusion is (15-r)/15
3. blockLight (torches etc.) is a separate BFS of RGB 3 channels (4bit packed)

So `l.skyLight` is not a mere brightness parameter but **voxel-resolution occlusion data of "whether sky is visible from here" = a shadow map**. Under trees, under roofs, and indoors it is already numerically low, arriving smoothed by vertex interpolation. Placing/breaking blocks recalculates immediately = **real-time-tracking shadows**. Vanilla only uses it "gently" via `mix(ambient, sky, skyLight)`.

The right tools are R9.12's two steps (**restore raw values via lift inversion → binarize with threshold `smoothstep`**. `th = 1 - r/15` directly dials "occlusion radius treated as shadow") plus **gating direct sun by sky** (sun only reaches where sky is visible = the essence of projection), composed with warm sunlit / cool shadow tinting.

**Honest limits**: these shadows are "upward sky" based, so **they don't rotate as the sun moves over time**. Resolution is per block (soft edges come from BFS spread). The engine lighting template still contains a closed `var shadow: f32 = 1.;` stub for shadow maps (always 1.0 = disabled) — interpreted as a trace of "planned" pixel-accurate rotating shadows. If pixel-accurate rotating shadows are a must, only out-of-API approaches remain (e.g. userscript GLSL injection, with policy risk).

### Underwater reality

Underwater looks consist of 3 layers:

| Layer | Content | Operable from packs? |
|---|---|---|
| ① Terrain/liquid rendering | Hook-processable. Light hooks are called normally underwater | Yes (works "under the veil") |
| ② Liquid-definition veil | Emissive fullscreen quad from the liquid block definition color/alpha at the camera position, drawn frontmost. The game setting `cameraTint` wins if set | No (neither color nor density changeable) |
| ③ cameraTint | Game setting | No |

Practical points: packs keep working underwater / the veil cannot be removed / underwater cannot be branched on (fogStart / fogEnd / fogColour don't change underwater, so fogVisibility can't detect it either).

## 16. Debugging tips

- Caves too bright → missing nonlinear `skyLight` curve (R2 cave recipe / R9.9)
- Blown-out days → lower pre-ACES exposure
- Nights too dark to see → secure minimum ambient (night `skyLightColour` is nearly black by premise)
- Over-hazed distance → lower aerial coefficients
- Torch surroundings all orange → lower the warm blend ratio (keep some raw tinted light)
- Blocks almost all white → light hook output total exceeds 1.0 (no clamp downstream). End with `clamp(col, vec3f(0.0), vec3f(1.0))`
- White without additions → un-fog inversion via fogVisibility division. Drop un-fog; rebuild from `s.colour` and `mix` fog once at the end
- Emissive blocks don't glow → missing emission re-add in rebuild recipes. Add `+ s.emission * l.fogVisibility`
- Night looks wrong only on lit faces → don't darken just shadow colors; decay the whole engine finished color (`engineColour`) at night. To keep local lamps, weaken decay with `blockLight` / `heldLight` ([Part VI](06-implementation.md), section 19)
- Shade won't deepen no matter the `pow(skyLight, γ)` → `l.skyLight` is post-lift (section 10). Switch to R9.12 inversion + threshold cut
- Tuning shadow area/density → see the R9.12 tuning guide (area = threshold `shTh` / edge = `shSoft` / core darkness = two-point shift of minimum ambient and sky scatter)
