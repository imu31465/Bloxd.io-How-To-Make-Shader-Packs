# Pack format

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `xkg8x` (verified in production 2026-11-04) · Status: Verified (re-measured on the live loader)

The whole pack model on one page — manifest, loader limits, per-frame uniform. For the step-by-step version see [Getting Started](../getting-started/manifest.md).

## pack.json

```json
{
  "apiVersion": 5,
  "name": "My Pack",
  "author": "your name"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiVersion` | number | required | **must strictly equal `5`** (`===`). A string `"5"` fails and is reported with its JSON spelling |
| `name` | string | required | non-empty after trimming; shown in settings |
| `author` | string | optional | must be a string if present |

Everything else in the manifest is ignored. `pack.json` must be exactly one JSON object at the zip root.

## Loader limits (re-measured on live c53)

| Limit | Value | Message when exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| `.wgsl` files per pack | 256 | `The pack has more than 256 .wgsl files.` |
| total `.wgsl` source | 256 KB | `The pack's .wgsl files are over 256 KB in total.` |
| `pack.json` size | 64 KB | `pack.json is over 64 KB.` |
| zip size | 32 MB | `The zip is over 32 MB.` |
| zip entries | 1,024 | `The zip has more than 1024 entries.` |
| zip shape | — | split zip / zip64 / encrypted / unsupported compression each rejected with its own message; all files valid UTF-8; exactly one `pack.json`; no duplicate paths |

## API-version check

The loader compares `manifest.apiVersion !== 5` with JavaScript strict `!==`. The version constant `5` and the header template live in the same module (c55 / module 29836), so validation and the header it assumes move together. Mismatch messages: see [Compatibility](compatibility.md).

## Per-frame uniform: bloxdPackInputs

`@group(3) @binding(0) var<uniform> bloxdPackInputs: BloxdPackInputs` — still 64 bytes, but v5 added one member (from the live uniform-layout module):

| Offset | Field | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `seconds` | `f32` | backs `bloxdSeconds()` |
| 4 | `lit` | `u32` | 1 when block/sky lighting is on; backs `bloxdLit()` |
| 16 | `renderOffset` | `vec3i` | backs `bloxdRenderOffset()` |
| 32 | `sunDirection` | `vec3f` | backs `bloxdSunDirection()` |
| 48 | `eyePosition` | `vec3f` | backs `bloxdEyePosition()` |

`lit` fit into the padding v4 already had between `seconds` and `renderOffset` (offsets 4–15 were alignment gaps; `vec3i` needs 16-byte alignment so `renderOffset` stays at 16). Total size and all other offsets are unchanged. The engine writes it with a single `setUint32(4, lit ? 1 : 0)` — it is a flag, not a light level (v4's JS-side names `terrainLightLevels` / `terrainHeldLight` are gone from the bundle entirely).

**Never reference the uniform directly from a pack.** Use it through the header functions (`bloxdSeconds()` etc.). Stage visibility is VERTEX|FRAGMENT, so header functions work from module-scope functions and vertex hooks too.

## Bind-group layout

| binding | Contents |
|---|---|
| 0 | `bloxdPackInputs` uniform (64 B) |
| 1 | scene-depth texture (liquid variants) |
| 2 | `bloxdSpTextureLayers` storage buffer |

`minBindingSize` remains 64. The depth texture (binding 1) is FRAGMENT-only, which is why `bloxdOpaqueBehind()` is surface/light-hook only.

## wgsl concatenation

Multiple `.wgsl` files are concatenated into one module in **dictionary order by path name**. Module-scope declarations are order-independent; only `var` initialization order can matter. Non-`.wgsl` files are ignored.
