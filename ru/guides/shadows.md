# Shadows

> Target API: 5 · Target build: `ab90qa` · Status: Verified (LightEngine behavior unchanged since v4 measurement)

The three ways to make "shadows" in a shader pack, and their limits.

## Can / cannot

| Effect | Possible? | How |
|---|---|---|
| Clearly darken under trees/roofs (projected-style) | ◎ | `skyLight` lift inversion + threshold cut (below) |
| Shadows follow block edits in real time | ◎ | LightEngine recalculates immediately — automatic |
| Color shadows cool / sunlit warm | ◎ | two-color shift |
| Shadows rotating with the sun (shadow map) | ✕ | depth is liquid-only; light-ray occlusion is not an input |
| Physical penumbra | ✕ | capped by voxel-resolution BFS spread |
| Real-time AO (SSAO) | ✕ | only the AO baked into vertex colors |

## skyLight is a voxel shadow map

`l.skyLight` is not just a brightness parameter. The mesher's LightEngine computes Minecraft-style **"can this position see the sky" voxel occlusion data — a shadow map**:

1. **Column scan**: each (x,z) column top-down; sky light starts at 15, hits 0 at opaque blocks, attenuates by `lightFilter` (air 1 / water 3 / opaque 15)
2. **BFS flood fill**: spreads horizontally to 6 neighbors (-1 per block) — this softens shadow edges. Under an occluder of radius r the raw value is (15-r)/15
3. blockLight (torches) is a separate RGB 3-channel (4-bit packed) BFS

Under trees, roofs and inside buildings the value is already low and interpolates smoothly per-vertex. Placing or breaking a block recalculates immediately — **real-time-following shadows**.

## The lift-curve trap

`l.skyLight` arrives **post-lift-curve** (`y = 1-(1-x/(3-2x))³`, an S-curve that lifts dark values):

| Place | Raw voxel | Lifted (= l.skyLight) | pow(·, 5.0) |
|---|---|---|---|
| open sky | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| under tree (radius 2) | 0.87 | **0.97** | **0.86** ← nearly kept |
| radius 3 | 0.80 | **0.92** | 0.66 |
| radius 5 | 0.67 | 0.78 | 0.29 |

**This is the proven root cause of "gamma doesn't darken shadows"** — even γ=5 only takes under-tree 0.97 down to 0.86.

## The fix: lift inversion + threshold cut

The curve is monotonic and inverts exactly: `c=(1-y)^(1/3); x=3(1-c)/(3-2c)`. Restore the raw value, then binarize with a **`smoothstep` threshold**. LightEngine's BFS spread is "-1 per adjacent block", so `th = 1 - r/15` is directly the "occlusion radius counted as shadow" dial.

The complete implementation (sun gating + warm/cool split + blockLight passthrough) is in [realism recipes](../recipes/realism.md). Key steps:

```wgsl
// 1. restore the raw value (skipping this means shadows never appear)
let skyRaw = sh_unlift(l.skyLight);
// 2. threshold-cut — sunlit 1 / shadow 0
let sky = smoothstep(shTh - shSoft, shTh + shSoft, skyRaw);
// the essence of projection: direct sun only reaches places that see the sky
let lit = sunL * sky;
```

Dials: **area** = `shTh` (0.93→radius 1.5 / 0.87→2 / 0.80→3 / 0.67→5); **edge softness** = `shSoft`; **core darkness** = the minimum ambient and sky-scatter two-point shift; long evening shadows ≈ `thEff = shTh + 0.10 * (1 - clamp(sunDir.y, 0.0, 1.0))`.

## Honest limits

- Shadows reference the **upward sky**, so they **do not rotate with the sun** (voxel resolution; soft edges come from BFS spread)
- The engine's lighting template retains an unused `var shadow: f32 = 1.;` (always 1.0 = disabled) — a plausible "future plans" trace for pixel-accurate rotating shadows
- Pixel-accurate rotating shadows are outside the current API ([Unreachable effects](constraints.md))
