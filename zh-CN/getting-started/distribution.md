# Distribution

> Target API: 5 · Status: Verified

## Release format

1. Zip with `pack.json` at the root, within the size limits ([Pack structure](pack-structure.md))
2. Verify `pack.json` sits at the zip root (a single common root folder is stripped automatically)
3. Polish `name` / `author` for release

## Pre-release checklist

- [ ] `apiVersion: 5` (number, not string)
- [ ] All 6 variants pass validation (empty error list on the loader screen)
- [ ] Verified visually in both an allow game and a strict game
- [ ] Vertex-animation / `discard` packs clearly marked allow-only
- [ ] Tested games and date noted in the release notes (builds change)

## After release

- Player-saved packs re-validate automatically when engine header or texture registry change with a game update
- **Packs distributed as v1–v4 become silently inactive** on v5 (see [pack.json](manifest.md)) — players only see the status line, so publish and announce an updated version
- When the API updates, follow [Version History](../history/) migration steps, bump, and re-release
