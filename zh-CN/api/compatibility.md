How the current game and old-version packs interoperate.

## Accepted versions

**Only `apiVersion: 5`.** The loader compares `manifest.apiVersion !== 5` strictly and v1/v2/v3/v4 packs **fail at the instant of load**. No multi-version acceptance exists.

## Load-time messages (verbatim from the live i18n dictionary)

- `pack.json needs "apiVersion": {{version}}.` — the `apiVersion` key is missing
- `This pack is shader pack API version {{packVersion}}. Bloxd supports version {{version}}.` — the key exists but isn't 5

## Saved old packs (no exceptions — silent inactivation)

Previously-saved v1–v4 packs don't throw. The saved-pack result resolves to:

```
{kind: "none", reason: "otherApiVersion"}
```

and the pack becomes **silently inactive**. Only the shader-pack settings tab explains why:

> `This shader pack is for API version {{packVersion}}, so it won't run. Load a version {{version}} pack to replace it.`

## The nature of the v4 → v5 conversion

The conversion is mostly mechanical (full checklist in [the v5 migration guide](../history/v5.md)):

- `blockFlags & bloxdBlockFlagX != 0u` → `flags.x` (a 1:1 rename)
- `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` → `if (bloxdLit()) { ... } else { return bloxdDefaultLight(...); }`
- delete `bloxdFragmentBlockPosition` call sites (no replacement)
- bump `pack.json` to `"apiVersion": 5`

The quiet trap this time: packs that keep reading `blockFlags` or wrapping light hooks in `#ifdef BLOXD_LIGHTING` **fail validation with dedicated messages** (the analyzer now explains both cases), so nothing misbehaves silently — they just stay refused until migrated.

## Saved-pack re-validation ("needs re-check")

`HEADER_VERSION` is `9.<fnv1a32(header)>.<fnv1a32(texture registry)>` (the leading integer went from v4's 8 to 9). When the engine's header or texture registry changes (common with game updates), saved packs are marked "needs re-check" and re-validate automatically on page load.

A measured example of registry movement (two builds, 10 days apart): entries 1200 → 1219 (98 added, 79 removed), and of the names that kept their spelling, **779 of 1121 changed id**. In other words:

- **packs written with names (`bloxdTextureIdLava`) survive drift** (the loader re-resolves against the live registry)
- **packs written with raw ids (`19`) break on re-validation**

Details: [Engine Internals: Texture Registry](../internals/texture-registry.md).

## Runtime environments

- **WebGPU-renderer only**: installing a pack force-enables the WebGPU renderer
- **Mobile**: WebGPU-limited environments can't run packs at all ([Requirements](../getting-started/requirements.md))
- **Non-atlas renderer configurations**: `bloxdTexel` / `bloxdTextureSize` degrade to stubs (white texels, 1×1); code still compiles and runs ([Texture API](texture-api.md#where-the-texture-api-cant-go))
